Weber) Subject: Need help with Mitsubishi P78U image printer Date: 15 Apr 1993 09:37:39 -0700 Lines: 26 Distribution: na  Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some help with it.  We bought this thing because it  has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and  claimed to print 256 gray level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but they didn\\'t have any information about how to program it to do so, and they would call Japan, etc.  Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images from the video source, it can\\'t store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It\\'s not like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would greatly appreciate your sending it to me.  Thanks.

Is it a simple reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space?  Is it a manipulation in the YUV color space?  How is it related to solarization?  If you want to see something truly wild, turn on the reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped, and point it at the monitor.

I\\'ll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)  Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case with no solution that worried me.  Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere  that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of.  These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly.  When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.

This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced  it can also be achieved by  If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle.   It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. points being colinear => coplanar)  Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial.   An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting at a point. This might be easier to implement.

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists  conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques.   Intuitive Graphic Interface  Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and  point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast. This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image  layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.  Image Format Compatibility  Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.  Image Analysis & Processing  For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and  mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution  product or principal component analyses. An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively. Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions.  Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis  Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.). The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands. A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation, and 3-D image projection.  Easy External Program Interfacing  Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions.  Quick Quality Presentation  Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images, graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports. Sphinx\\'s 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as  histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers. Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external  graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?  Software Support & Development  Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d\\'Optique Atmospherique  of the Universite de Lille, France. The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), and the French space agency, Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features on-line help, is supported by an Internet address  sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and version updates provided without delay.  Performance Tested  CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data  collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today, the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center and is widely used in many French laboratories, including the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l\\'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure , Laboratoire d\\' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire  de Meteorologie Dynamique.   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)  IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE. HOWEVER THE VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS IS SUFFICIENT TO WORK WITH.

Can someone please give me there opion on such a setup for running NT and is the Operating System likely to be better than Windows or  Unix\\'s.   Steve ee_d316@uk.ac.king.ceres  I\\'ve been using Windows NT  since the October release, and I have to  say that the March release is really a big improvement.  Windows NT  is becomming usable.  There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though. First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box. What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other resourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.   And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter),  please let me know.  The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff. For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn\\'t  produced drivers yet.  Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and give the rest over to Windows NT .  The only thing is, whenever you wanted to run Windows programs, you\\'d have to reboot and log into Windows NT , instead of just typing WIN.  Windows NT  does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows though.  It\\'d be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I\\'ve never heard of anyone else who did either.  It\\'s only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the box, whereas with UNIX there isn\\'t the same availablity.  I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT  is not yet for the faint of heart, it\\'s still a beta.  But it\\'s a very GOOD beta.

Usually it confines itself to not copying things to the clipboard (so I have to save and load pix for editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.  The one nice thing it has, though, is it\\'s \"dither\" option.  You\\'d think that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say, colors to 16 colors.  But if you go from 256 or 16 colors to B&W, you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which turn to white.  For me, this is useful because I can turn light grays on buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.

I don\\'t think the question is: will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?\"  A more important question is: will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps from subsequent Windows versions in the future?\"  Can it keep up?  Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps? OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come. After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to view Microsoft code.  After that, the only way to maintain some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  Would you want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?    John A.

A problem with TT fonts in Windows is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution.    So when you print to an attached PS printer, with the PS driver set up for this printer results, may be quite good.

Get DOS 6, not worth buying if you already have QEMM/PCTools/Norton, and you only need the move utility.  the manual doesn\\'t seem to have all of them.  I\\'m particularly looking for COPY, in order to make a \"move\" batch file, such that if the file wasn\\'t coppied properly, it won\\'t be deleted.   please e\\'mail louray@seas.gwu.edu Thanks, I.A, Mickey  pe-|| ||  MICHAEL PANAYIOTAKIS: louray@seas.gwu.edu  ace|| ||                                   ...!uunet!seas.gwu.edu!louray how do make a ms-windows .grp file reflect a HD directory??* well I ain\\'t always right, but I\\'ve never been wrong..\"    Agus Budy Wuysang                                 | Digitech Student                                  | Monash University (Clayton)                       | Melbourne, Australia                              |  </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/9915\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/comp.os.ms-windows.misc/9915\"> From: srowe@fulcrum.co.uk (Simon Rowe) Subject: Re: exit codes (dos--sorry for wrong group : ( Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 10:40:41 GMT Lines: 13  Internal DOS commands (certainly 3.3 and before) do not set the exit code.

I get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work, a MHz with 4MB RAM, Windows 3.1, with Dos 5.0.    At home (on a 386 40MHz, 8MB RAM, Windows 3.1 and Dos 5.0) I *never* get these.    Any idea what could be wrong?  Someone already suggested I check for tmp files in the windows/temp directory, there are none there.  The message I get is:  This application has violated system integrity due to an invalid general protection fault and will be terminated.  I only have this problem with applications running in DOS boxes (with or without .pif files setup for them).  Any hints/help greatly appreciated.

For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is reserved for LPT2.  Since it\\'s rare to have a second parallel port in a PC, it\\'s usually a good safe choice if you need an interrupt.  On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1, a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn\\'t work.

Will the higher resolution be noticed for these?  If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript. I don\\'t see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language that is suited for the job.  Besides I don\\'t think PCL is even capable of handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript. It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent PC you know it\\'s going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation processed PS.  The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I\\'m rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I\\'d say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master\\'s demo though).  I don\\'t know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several.

There are two \\'problems\\': the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the meantime, and the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first \\'get date\\' call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set).

However, to configure netware WM> for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   Yes.  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two disks at once.  Duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses two controller cards and two disk drives.  Duplexing requires a special card and two identical disk drives (in most cases).  Duplexing can sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives/controllers, as long as the sizes are the same.  WM> So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  The configuration is completely up to the user.  WM> 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this WM> what is causing my serialization error?  If you only have one disk, then you can\\'t use Level II SFT.  However, the OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error.  Make sure that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the NetWare installation set.  WM> 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, WM> one of which has failed?  Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume mirrored using SFT II.  Impossible to tell with the network being down.  WM> 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it WM> will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive?  Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and installing the software as one volume under SFT I.  If the software will install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work in this configuration.  WM> 4. What else can cause a serialization error?  See the comment concerning the serial number on the OSOBJ installation floppy.  WM> 5. What happens if the keycard fails?  What is the keycard attached to?

They\\'re very recent, I downloaded them from the  Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there,  email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.   I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think  the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

Sometimes, if I then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD. I\\'ve called La Cie again and they\\'ve given me another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\\'t see the drive there\\'s a definite hardware problem.  Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one, but they said \"no.\" Also, within three weeks after I purchased my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.  I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\\'ll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data recovery.)  It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new.   I feel a little helpless about all this. I don\\'t mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful. But c\\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent a letter to La Cie\\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\\'t even  have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)  What\\'s the moral of this story? I\\'m not sure. But I do know I won\\'t buy any other products from La Cie in the future.  Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu  PS Please don\\'t email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has been. I\\'m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that. All I\\'m saying is that I\\'ve had a disappointing experience with them and I\\'ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.  </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/comp.sys.mac.hardware/50453\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/comp.sys.mac.hardware/50453\"> From: Alexander Samuel McDiarmid  Subject: Re: SE Serial Port Speed????

After many calls (almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me \"Why we never received your old chips.\"  I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them, to which the person replied \"You mean you sent them US Mail?\" (which I had, per the original sales person\\'s instructions.)  I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were absolutely no help.

(Sorry for length).  To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively. This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some aluminum foil down to work on. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables, spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out. Remove the flopy drive. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting the supply straight up and out. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom side of the fan and lifting straight up and out. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and right side of the board and sliding the board forward then lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the board must be removed first) Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules). This is not easy even for a skilled solderer. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder  them in. Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock. Put large power transistor heat sink\\'s on the processor chip and  the other large chip just to the right of the processor and figure some way to hold the heat sync\\'s in place. I made a simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat sync\\'s to hold them in place. Don\\'t use too much pressure.  Put it all back together and go-for-it.

The second part is  posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about system  software.  The third part is posted every two weeks in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Tables of contents for those two pieces are included above. Please familiarize  yourself with all three sections of this document  before posting.   All pieces  are available for anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh.  Except for this introductory FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as general-faq.Z, the name of each file has the format of the last part of the group name followed by \"-faq.Z\", e.g the FAQ for comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z.  RTFM stores files as  compressed  BINARY files.  If you leave off the .Z at the end of  the file name when \"getting\" the file, rtfm will automatically  decompress the file before sending it to you.  You can also have  these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to  mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line:  send pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/\"name\"  in the body text where name\" is the name of the file you want as  specified above (e.g. general-faq).  You can also send this server a message with the subject \"help\" for more detailed instructions.        I HAVE A QUESTION...     Congratulations!  You\\'ve come to the right place.  Usenet is  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs.  P.S.  I\\'m running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.)   Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before, and it\\'s developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup news.announce.newusers.   HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?     comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces, a general introduction which you\\'re reading now, and specific lists for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by faq\", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is stored compressed so you\\'ll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the \".Z\" extension when you \"get\" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you.   This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the FAQ even if you don\\'t have the other parts at hand.  It\\'s not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a particular question or comment should be posted.  Please familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong where.   To jump to a particular question search for section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For example to find \"Where can I FTP Macintosh software?\" search for the string  \"\".  To jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for  the question number.   WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?    comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It\\'s posted to that group weekly and  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in  pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you\\'re reading now is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac, telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform conversion and printing.  It\\'s available in comp.fonts or by ftp from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple\\'s UNIX environment, A/UX.  It\\'s posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux and news.answers. It\\'s available for anonymous ftp at jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.   WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?    There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones.  You wouldn\\'t ask your English teacher how to do the definite integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don\\'t ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their ways of  communicating.    Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm, normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software designers.  Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post.  If a question isn\\'t important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it\\'s not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading.  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a catch-all newsgroup.  The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup.  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions about non-communications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.  Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc, comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking.   A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how\\'s of a program as well as the what\\'s (Recent example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages?) might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.  For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We understand that you\\'re desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How \\'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Finally don\\'t be so provincial as to consider only the comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions.  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI are often better handled in comp.music even though it\\'s not a Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet\\'s a big place and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in comp.sys.mac.   SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN\\'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?  No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium for answering common questions like this one.  You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that lets me send PWFAQ\\'s (people with frequently asked questions) the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please don\\'t feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they can\\'t be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.     FTP      WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?    The three major North American Internet archives of shareware, freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu which mirrors the other two sites and several others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above sites.  To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),   ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1).  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp   A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).  This is Apple\\'s semi-official repository for system software, developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things that come more or less straight from Apple\\'s mouth.  Some material at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other sites that don\\'t have an official license to distribute Apple system software.  Please read the various README documents available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you\\'re connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute material you find here.   CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?    The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu).  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the words \"help\" and \"index\" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a message with just the text \"help\" (no quotes).   WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?    If you can\\'t find what you\\'re looking for at one of the above sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject \"help.\"  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15, America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7, the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as \"archie\" no password is needed) and type \"prog filename\" to find what you\\'re looking for or type \"help\" for more detailed instructions.  For instance you would type \"prog Disinfectant\" to search for a convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of the name.  For instance if you didn\\'t find Disinfectant with \"prog Disinfectant\", you might try \"prog disi\" instead.  Substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many erroneous matches add a \".*\\\\.hqx\" to the end of the substring, e.g. prog disi.*\\\\.hqx\"  Most Mac software available on the net ends in hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does.   Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software.   CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?    No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.   WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?    Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they\\'re compressed to make them faster to download, and then they\\'re translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary protocol.  How a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file you\\'ve FTP\\'d and downloaded to your Mac you\\'ll need to reverse the process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh files as they are downloaded.   Suffix:      .sit  .cpt  .hqx  .bin  .pit  .Z  .image  .dd  .zip .uu  .tar  Extractors  StuffIt 3.0|   X     X     X     X     X                   Compact Pro|         X     X  Packit     |                           X UUTool     |                                                      X  MacCompress|                                X  SunTar     |               X     X     X                                X  BinHex 5.0 |                     X  BinHex 4.0 |               X  DiskDoubler|                           X                X  UnZip      |                                                   X  DiskCopy   |                                     X  macutil    |         X     X           X                X   A few notes on the decompressors:  StuffIt is a family of products that use several different compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1, StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0.  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt Expander.   StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.  UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX formats of  uuencode , compress , and tar (.tar) respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac products, so use them instead when that\\'s an  option.  Translators that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous ftp.   Macutil is dik winter\\'s package of UNIX utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be automatically converted on download.  It can\\'t decompress everything. In particular it can\\'t decompress the new StuffIt 3.0 archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the info-mac/unix directory.  A few notes on the compression formats:  bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text.  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they\\'ll be downloading MacBinary files.  image: This format is normally used only for system software, so that on-line users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve Christensen\\'s freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive.  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.  sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don\\'t merit a position in the above table because they\\'re self-extracting.  They may have been created with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self-extracting archives created with their  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.   HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?    By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you\\'re at a university there\\'s absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy; and if you\\'re anywhere less remote than McMurdo Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center, dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt.  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don\\'t need BinHex.  If you\\'re such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of StuffIt from a local bulletin board system.   If you have religious objections to software gotten by any  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I\\'ll mention that  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and  login.  Type the word \"binary.\"  Hit return.  Type \"cd mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression\" and hit return.  Then get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin\"  and hit return.  Of course it\\'s always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something similar.  If you\\'ve ftp\\'d straight onto your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If you\\'ve ftp\\'d to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.   HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?    You can\\'t.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp. You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may  terrify those among you who haven\\'t left your parents\\' basement  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you\\'re going  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.   though I suppose if you\\'re this much of  a nerd you could send  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you\\'re gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world  of daylight, please don\\'t bother the net by asking this question again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.     TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG    While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific problems, there are far more problems that aren\\'t covered here.  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step preventative maintenance routine described in section four, especially rebuilding the desktop  and resizing the system heap .  Following these steps may  or may not solve your problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to recommend solutions to you.  IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.    Microsoft Word is crashing\" doesn\\'t say much.  What were you doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash?  The more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you.  The more precisely you\\'ve identified the problem and the actions preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the problem.  For example, \"Sometimes QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error.\" is not nearly as helpful as \"QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain text.\"  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it\\'s still there or not.   READ THE READ ME FILE.    Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren\\'t documented in the manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound familiar.   CHECK FOR VIRUSES.    Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.   REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.      For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields, improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file on a disk may not contain the data it\\'s supposed to contain.  This can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring from original masters will normally fix this.   REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous.  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean reinstall.   If the problem continues to occur after you\\'ve taken these steps, chances are you\\'ve found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program.  So it\\'s time to   ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.      You need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash:  a.\\tRun only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes  the crash.  b.\\tIf you\\'re running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you\\'re running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you  can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially  when performing complicated operations.  c. If you\\'re running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit addressing.  There\\'s still an awful lot of System 7 hostile software out there including some from companies that really  have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?   I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its  incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.  d.\\tBoot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated, either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set back.  Continue until you\\'ve narrowed the conflict down to one extension.  When you think you\\'ve found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make  sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.   CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.    By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the software, call it.  If you\\'re lucky the company will have a work around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they\\'ll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.     PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE     You wouldn\\'t drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who\\'ll be happy to charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there\\'s no reason you can\\'t change it yourself.  The following nine-step program should be performed about every three months.    TRASH UNNEEDED FILES    Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you\\'re at all like me, you\\'ll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have, archives of software you\\'ve dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn\\'t like, announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer need.  If you\\'re running System 7 you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty  the trash.   RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS    Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension  in your collection.  If you don\\'t use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you\\'re probably better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup.  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there\\'s no need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid crashes.    REBUILD THE DESKTOP    The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created it.  It lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display where.  Depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac.  Every so often it\\'s necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean slate.  Fortunately it\\'s easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent.   One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you\\'ve stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice Volaski\\'s freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only  if Apple\\'s Desktop Manager extension is also installed.   To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys.  You\\'ll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that \"This could take a few minutes.\"  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you have the longer it will take.  If you\\'re running System 6 you may want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.  If you\\'re experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation\\'s freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly corrupt data structures.       ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK    All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950 contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this \"parameter RAM\" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command, Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter RAM.  Since you\\'ve erased almost all the settings in the General Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.  The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you\\'ll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway.   RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP     Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn\\'t big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap, knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.  If you\\'re using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary; but if you\\'re running System 6 it\\'s important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all.  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg\\'s freeware utility BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be allocated.  If you\\'re running System 6, get BootMan, use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.   REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE    System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if you\\'ve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them.  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here\\'s how:  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.   Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out  of your System file into a temporary suitcase. Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the  Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple  extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be  replaced in the new installation.  If you\\'re running or  installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions,  Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level  of the System Folder. Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder  is  fine. Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then  choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your  model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead,  but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don\\'t  need that waste your memory and disk space. Once installation is finished, move everything from the  temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System  folder.  If you\\'re asked if you want to replace anything, you  forgot to take something out in step 3.  You\\'ll need to replace  things individually until you find the duplicate piece.  Reinstall any fonts or DA\\'s you removed in step 2. Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file  that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable  system overall.   DISK UTILITIES    Much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System disks. It\\'s also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier  version, you should get the latest version  from ftp.apple.com and run it on all your hard disks.  Several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general work are Central Point\\'s MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation\\'s Public Utilites, and Symantec\\'s Norton Utilities for the Macintosh A department or work group should have all of these as well as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do.  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.  All of these products occasionally encounter problems they can\\'t fix.  When that happens it\\'s time to backup  and reformat .   BACKING UP    This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it\\'s easy to only back up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk.   A number of programs are available to make backing up easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.  Finally if you\\'re lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street, doesn\\'t support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD Backup from System 6.     DISK DEFRAGMENTATION    As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several ways to defragment a hard disk.  The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while you\\'re at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.  A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e. without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag about their safety, once you\\'ve bought the software and opened the shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don\\'t annoy the net by asking for one.    REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)  Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don\\'t need to reformat every three months; but when your system is crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3 megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive capacity.  When you reformat there\\'s no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space Apple\\'s left on your disk.  Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software.  Apple\\'s disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY.  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk.  A number of general-purpose formatters are also available which go beyond the bundled software to include features like encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition street for either).  While there are one or two freeware formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones bundled with your hard disk.   PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and data losses are a very good possibility.

Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.  Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far. I didn\\'t have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds.  Parts  Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.  I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:  mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121) mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136) mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)  Don\\'t get the half size clock oscillators. They won\\'t fit.  There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven\\'t tried one in a Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi\\'s)  Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.  Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a  must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up  something similar or risk frying your CPU.  Procedure  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac.  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up. The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you need release.  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard. The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it.  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here.  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle, rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.  Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The motherboard then comes directly out.  Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.  Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.  I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without proper care.  Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.  Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new mhz clock.  Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.  Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.  Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.  Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case. Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place.  Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT\\'T FORGET THE FLOPPY DRIVE CABLE.  Replace the phillips head screw  Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.  Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.  Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn  on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn\\'t, something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.  Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and be astounded.   You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single problem.  Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than in parts.

If you\\'re at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu  I\\'m compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces, I\\'m just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one screen.  I\\'d prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you don\\'t live near here. Only problem is that I didn\\'t keep the original boxes for the monitors, but I\\'m confident that my few months of full-time service in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and flip it in your direction.  Details:  Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:  SOLD**  Sony 1304 14\" color monitor:  What\\'s to say? It got top ratings in last year\\'s MacUser report. It\\'s a SONY, Trinitron, arguably the best (but I\\'d rather not argue that point). It\\'s a great monitor, in great shape, but I\\'m going to a bigger screen, and although I\\'d like to keep it, finances don\\'t justify it.  Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not including shipping), will sell for **$400** [was $475 orig. asking price] plus shipping). Again, make an offer if that sounds unreasonable.   RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):  Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13\" monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg SIMMS).  Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I\\'m asking was $525 orig. asking price](shipping included this time, it\\'s just a card). Original box and packaging. I\\'d actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a \"bundled offer\" for these items.  If you check the May 93 (or was it Feb 93) Macworld mag, you\\'ll find that the sx (or 24si - same thing) board did extremely well in the tests for 13-14\" x 480 24-bit boards. Also supports up to 1120 (or so) x 512 in 24-bit, so you can fit two pages width-wise via the scrolling desktop thang. It\\'s a great board, but I\\'m going to a 19\" monitor, and it can\\'t help me there.    Cheers.    Dan Keldsen            |  Are you now, or have you ever been: djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu |  a.

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect) that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUE\\'s window is overlaid on top of the root window.

As the Linux and BSD communities grow, however, I think that Motif will lose some of its grip, at least in the non-commercial marketplace.    Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups pertaining to Motif has been high.  I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial and non-commercial software (ie. you will only get free software using Athena or OpenLook widget sets, and only get commercial software using the Motif widget sets).    I can\\'t see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the \"free\" UNIX platforms, I can\\'t see this causing major problems.   I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software. Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix. An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I\\'m not really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license. Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.

I am curious to find out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running DV/X is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response time.  Anyone have any ideas ??    I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. It\\'s not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have people running programs off it, you\\'re going to see some slowdowns because you\\'re now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you\\'ll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you\\'re going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...)

There\\'s documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution.  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn\\'t grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments  to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec\\'s 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don\\'t seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isn\\'t that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.  I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)  Rob </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/comp.windows.x/67244\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/comp.windows.x/67244\"> From: garym@ie.utoronto.ca (Gary Murphy) Subject: X on Amiga 4000?

You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window.

Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie where to get the latest version). For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable vanilla X\\' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.  To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on  pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/  The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from POVRay 1.0   The version I have is using the x256q code instead of the default X Windows code.  I have it currently running on a DEC Alpha running OpenVMS AXP and so far have been pretty impressed.  The only \"side-effect\" of x256q is that it requires xstdcmap -best be run before it will work, annoyning but not a show stopper.  Patrick L.

In the version on export one cannot just specify a POSIX tty behaviour, the POSIX config files are incomplete without those of some specific platforms like Suns and DECs. I looked twice at porting emu to linux, but stopped short becuse of the tty part. Is there a `cleaner\\' version of emu that supports POSIX tty explicitly?  Hmm, depends on how you define \\'clean\\'. Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for, call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven\\'t encountered a  OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven\\'t gotten around to really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than \\'#ifdef\\'ing in existing ones. The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a  couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the  drivers\" actually included from the toplevel include file will be  compiled into emu.  It shouldn\\'t be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don\\'t have a linux system available to me, so I can\\'t do the port myself.

Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur\\'an  Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur\\'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.    As usual there seems to be almost as many Islamic viewpoints as there are Muslims.    Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.   It all comes back to the Koran being so imprecise in its wording.  The Qur\\'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words.

Is this is a fair premise? I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of truth.  If you met a man who could walk on water, raise people from the dead, claimed to be the Son of God, and then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures, this would affect your belief in the origin of man.

I have yet to find *one single muslim* who has convinced me that they have read the book.  Some have initially claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book than a superficial Newsweek story might impart, and all have made factual misstatements about events in the book.  You keep saying things like this.  Then, you accuse people like me of making ad hominem arguments.  I repeat, as I have said in previous postings on AA: I *have* read TSV from cover to cover  I had not seen that claim, or I might have been less sweeping.  You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the \"ISLAM: a clearer view\" thread as well as the root of the \"Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]\" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven\\'t read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn\\'t in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the \"a clearer view\" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance \"Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores\"), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you\\'ll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that \"TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims\".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.  I am trying very hard to be amicable and rational.    And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.

If you\\'re interested in a change, here\\'s an idea.  Do you believe in absolute morality? And do you have absolute knowledge? Mere mortal you? And if you claim that your God has absolute knowledge, then you have have absolute knowledge of that?  If you read the Bible and claim that it is the Word of God, and in it is contained the absolute moral code you ascribe to, but the prophets, no matter how divinely inspired are not gods but mere fallable mortals, then how can you be absolutely sure that they having heard the Word of God, have got it right? Also, you read their words in translation which invariably introduces errors of nuance and usage, and then how do you know that you got the right message? I assert that you do not, and that you do not have absolute knowledge of anything, including absolute morals.  The only way you can assert such things is through appeal to prejudice via appeal by force of authority through yourself or a group you have aligned yourself to.  If morals come from what is societally accepted, why follow that?   Because social pressure is the most powerful force known to man. How can you disprove a contention that the richeousness of established religion is anything other than social convention? One way is to assert that there are moral universals. But that is not the same thing as asserting that these universials owe their origen to trancendance or the supernatural or to dieties.  What right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally mandated morality?  We expect empathy from our fellow man. We expect to raise each generation with values that we live by, those which assure that mistakes we have made are not repeated. Do you think that mere authority checks all tendancies which are disruptive of civilized life? I think not! In fact authority is power, and power corrupts. The most powerful tend to think that they are above the law that applies to everybody else. Religious authority, theocarcy, has not mitigated this any better than other power structures on this score and it seems that because there are no checks on power concentrated in clergy or nobility that the abuses recorded by history are greater.  We live and teach morals by setting an example, starting in the home. This does not come from books or authority figures in soceity. If people are weak or confused at the present time it is not because the breakup of the family has been precipitated by some mysterious moral decidance that redidication to traditional formulas will repair. That is but magical and simplistic thinking. We need to look at forces in the way we live, even the good things that happen in our present culture, that are weakening the family as the primary means we have to teach children values. Of course people are trying to have the community do things that once were done in the family alone. This may not be as effective. We need to look at this.  Pardon the extremism, but couldn\\'t I murder your \"brother\" and say that I was  exercising my rights as I saw them, was doing what felt good, didn\\'t want anyone forcing their morality on me, or I don\\'t follow your \"morality\" ?  Laying down the law, and with teeth, doesn\\'t stop the crazy man from murdering your brother despite the morality or the law. It may help you with dealing promptly with him after the fact, but it may not be very effective for preventing mental illness or cracy people from murduring.  It is quite interesting how ineffective moral authoritarianism is in fact. It may work best in societies that are already sonmewhat isolated, that do not experience change, and have long standing traditions. In a basic way moral codes decrease the number of decisions people have to make everyday. In a real sense thay allow people to not have to think. That is OK when things are stable, but it becomes a problem when conditions change. This leads me to think that morals are not sumething fundemental, at least most of them, recalling that there are values all people seem to agree on, but mutate in response to outside political, economic, technical, and cultural influiences.  Lately, I have come to regard people who speak like you with great suspicion, especially when they include the pharse \"for the children.\". I think that such people are more of an imparative to want to  control what others do and think than other more nobil pursuits, such as of the truth.

Although it is often used in a colloquial manner to refer to phenomena that tend toward higher complexity and ability, evolution simply implies change, for good or for bad.  In the scientific sense, evolution is merely the change in allele frequencies for a given population over a period of time.  This is usually what people refer to when they discuss the scientific fact of evolution.  We observe such shifts in allele frequencies occurring all the time, so it is trivial to conclude that evolution is a scientific fact.

Sometimes I get tired, and  sometimes I have other things I\\'d rather do.  Again, this is USENET, and life is tough all over.  You\\'re going to have to deal with it.  You\\'re starting to get personally insulting; I may not even put your name in the hat in future.  That\\'s supposed to be a threat?  No, that\\'s a simple statement, and an assertion that I am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults.  For example, those who accuse me  of lying about my personal beliefs, while also complaining that I don\\'t answer their questions.    Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there. If only everything would be so easy.  What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there. Because to all intents and purposes, it *is* there. We had that argument. For one, your claim that everyone senses it is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often. And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found.  I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\\'s a good point, and I\\'m thinking about it.  Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know, therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process, restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological claim, you have to prove it.  Nonsense.  My \"trick\" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so  does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore  that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.  Now get this:  \"really is better\" is an idealisation, a fictional model, in the same sense that \"real material existence\" is a fictional model. It may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist  trick\", to wit:  I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person I ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B, or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B, then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing more can be said.    I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that  a supermajority\\'s carefully considered morality would be better than the  terrorist\\'s - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion.  For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others.  If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense).  It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute. And as long as you don\\'t provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis.  I\\'ve done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to  answer jon\\'s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning.  Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective, you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes above look quite misleading.  Not really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently of humans?  You\\'ll be hard pressed to find any that isn\\'t logically equivalent when applied to values.  An analogous set of premises would be:  Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance of the estate, and down the Malahide road.  Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my which is much closer.  You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim, using premises which are logically no different.   No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here. And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed. In other words,  your analogy works only when one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not, it is a fallacy.  And if this were an argument for objectivism, you\\'d be right.  It isn\\'t, though, it\\'s a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.  Your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values aren\\'t real, and to use this to \"prove\" that values aren\\'t real.  In other words, you beg the question against me.

I\\'m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean, though.  How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self- consistent? I\\'d be amazed if it was more than one. How many different moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?  Begging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are saying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about it.  Why?  Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity\\'s sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can have.  I\\'m saying the Universe has a \"real age\", because I see evidence for it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of people\\'s opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results.  The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be emirically verified through means that\\'ll give the same result no matter who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side...).   This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality which doesn\\'t depend on what we think.  I can\\'t see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations, see to it he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be the same.  Why should an extreme Biblical Creationist give a rat\\'s ass about the means of which you speak?  Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we conducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don\\'t, which I take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.  I\\'ve heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to enlighten me?  The same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean physical pain. You have a sharp point, I\\'ll give you that; but you still haven\\'t given me a way to quantify morality.  I wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.  We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality\" towards which these changes could gravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable, producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.  If a moral system makes a prediction \"It will be better if...\", that can be tested,  Better\" and \"worse\" are (almost?) always defined in the context of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within* that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of good\" and \"bad\"; I wish you luck.  People\\'s *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective; you can have any idea you like, and I can\\'t stop you. Universae and their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are, and if you dislike some detail of them, that\\'s a problem with your *opinion* of them.   Sure.  Assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.  Isn\\'t that what _you\\'re_ doing, when assuming an \"objectively real\" morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my statement?  I claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such subjective and individual. If I\\'m wrong, then some more-or-less objectively \"real\" thing exists, which you label \"objective morality\"; can you back up this positive claim of existence?  Can you back up your positive claim above?  No.  That\\'s because it\\'s an assumption.  I make the same assumption about values, on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same.  Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was objective\", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir incorrect\\' morality seems to function fine. How come?  As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick them from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).  deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]  Now take a look at morality. See anything? If so, please inform me which way to look, and WHY to look that particular way, as opposed to some other. Get my drift?  No. Just look.  Are you claiming never to know what good means?  One thing is \"good\" under some circumstances, because we wish to achieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something else, and that thing is no longer so clearly \"good\" at all.  Some things are hard to make \"good\", because we\\'d seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still, the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.  I almost always know what \"good\" means; sometimes I even know why. I never claim this \"good\" is thereby fixed in stone, immutable.   That\\'s a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method.  I think it\\'s great, and should be applied to values.  I may be completely wrong, but that\\'s what I conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought.

If I wanted to do this for _Alice in Wonderland_, I\\'d visit the British Museum where I would find the original manuscript and be able to compare it to the printed edition that I own (I\\'d find many differences including a different title). Likewise, if I had a cast of _Archaeopteryx_, I could take it to Berlin to compare it to the original fossil found at Solenhofen.

Pretend someone says to you someday there will be men on the moon.  (Now remember, you still think the world is flat).  This is quite an extraordinary claim.  I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the world is flat.  However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in  voluntarly actions. I don\\'t think Plato would have been happy with this, and neither would Paul, although Paul\\'s ideas were quite different. However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in favour of these statements.  The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don\\'t believe in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.  The fact is we can argue the existence of God until the end of time, there really is no way to either prove or disprove it, but there will be a time when we all know the truth.

You might be as well planting Satan\\'s seeds, ever thought of this?

This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories.  There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text  of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same \"errors\".  This would appear to tell us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don\\'t know what they did before that.

What all of these \"deathbed conversion\" claims have in common is that they are utterly unsubstantiated, and almost certainly untrue.  Perhaps the least believable and most infurating alleged conversion was that of Tom Paine, reported, like most, only by his devout relatives.  Asimov was very unlikely to convert to Christianity on his deathbed. Return to Judaism, perhaps, if he did revert to childhood training, but Christianity?  The Good Doctor would more likely have converted to Hinduism.  Isaac Asimov read creationist books.  He read the Bible.  He had ample opportunity to kneel before his Creator and Savior.  He refused.  In fact, he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the American Humanist Association, shortly before he died.\"  excerpt from Ken Ham, \"Asimov Meets His Creator,\" _Back to Genesis_ No. 42, June 1992, p. c (included in _Acts & Facts_ vol. 21, no. 6, June 1992, from the Institute for Creation Research).

This device when used with a VCR tuner will allow you to have a second channel popped up on any corner of the screen. The you can press SWAP on the remote and the small picture will be swapped with the main picture.  The only limitation to this box is that it is has 36 channel tuner. This means that the box itself cannot tune higher than cable channel 36. However, if your VCR tuner is capable of tuning higher than this, then you simply tune the VCR to the channel desired and then swap pictures (assuming the alternate picture is channel 36 or lower) and it will work fine.

The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.

I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn\\'t have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.  True of Northern Europe, latin countries are something else.  The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than Kindof true. remember they were build by adolf in the \\'30\\'s.  they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them far more predictable than most US highways.  Yes.  Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have  Autobahn\" is the german word for freeway. Other countries have different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway etc.  speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not much higher than 120km/h.  Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn\\'t passed as far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.

If something happens at 130-150 you\\'re dead, but the same goes for much over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic because most people seem to be awake.

I\\'m amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).  MK48T02 from thomsom.  It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which has a lithium battery backup.  The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff operation.  Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not draw much current.  The battery would only be used when your auto battery was dead or had been removed.  Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has.  In California they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states that the odometer mileage is correct.  If incorrect you are required to  fill in what you know (or guesstimate) to be the correct mileage.  If you lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can sue you for the value of the mileage differential.

Two shots at it:  Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars, you\\'re down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the bars - that\\'s no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning. You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.  Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don\\'t grip as well as soft ones.

Don\\'t get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San  Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!!

I\\'ve wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake of my life!)  Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit. The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger; a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.  Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.  The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.

I don\\'t have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:  Any stories on how you all learned?  I\\'ll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.  Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner\\'s course, so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.  I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then I also passed my road test.  On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb), I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late, skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed.  Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did.  So my advice is to take the MSF beginner\\'s course first thing.  I wouldn\\'t even buy a bike until you\\'ve taken the course, unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you\\'re ready to use it.  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have  to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I\\'m too  ignorant to know I need to buy)  While you\\'re waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in DC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you save up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear, plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration and licensing fees, plus the course, you\\'re looking at maybe $600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in  about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a  motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes a difference)  I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200 in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be poor.  I\\'d guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo more expensive.  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?  There used to be annual buyer\\'s guides in the usual motorcycle magazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available.  You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend\\'s advice instead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW\\'s running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted.  Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping, were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren\\'t the latest models (hence cheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.

If by \"quick wiggle to the right\" you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right before turning to the left, what is the input to the steering mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old shove-shove\"?  Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean. Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left. To do this, you have to push against something, and the only thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well, the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the  ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to  the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground  pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.   The rear wheel doesn\\'t care (unless you have serious bearing  problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end),  but the front wheel has trail.

Good players come up young; most players who come up young will be good.  This has always been the rule.   Are most players who come up young always good when they\\'re young, or later?  Worse: it\\'s not a \"shift\".  This is the way it has *always* been.  Several detailed studies of this have been done, and they\\'ve all shown that players aren\\'t coming up any younger or older than in the past, and they aren\\'t  playing any more or less in the minors than they used to.  The only thing that shifts is our memories of the \"good old days\" :-).  Damn.  I was afraid you would say that!   But all after the fact, which makes it *not* applicable to the current discussion, which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who hasn\\'t \"established himself\" in the majors over the mediocre veteran.  The Padres played Santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth playing.    Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.   Both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers, expected to be among the best ever in baseball.    Not by rec.sport.baseball consensus.  That may sound like an incredibly arrogant comment, but I\\'ve found that the SDCN consensus (when one exists) is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of \"baseball people\" affiliated with MLB.    I can believe that.  I\\'m a newbie here, so I\\'ll take your word.  But Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above. That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to give him that dreaded \"seasoning\".   I don\\'t know \"who knows\".  I suppose the same people (or similar) who know\" he will be better than some other catcher.  These are, of  course, just differing opinions.  I read that his arm is not that strong (I suppose somewhere there is some measurement of SB ratios) and that he is still learning to call a game.  That latter skill may be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of his performance, but it is a tangible skill.  I disagree, in that I don\\'t think it *is* a _tangible_ skill, any more than leadership is.  I don\\'t deny that it is a *real* skill, and that some catchers may be much better than others at it, but I really don\\'t see any way that we could ever know who they are.  Nichols\\'s Law of Catcher Defense is eerily accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very seriously.  Sorry.  New.  Don\\'t know Nichols\\' Law.  Don\\'t believe in catchers\\' era.  But I am interested in pitchers\\' eras with different catchers. Any info on that?    Absolutely.  The evidence is piling up, year after year.  The only other alternative is that the Braves really don\\'t *know* that their young players are, on average, better than their current starters.  I\\'m not ruling out that kind of gross incompetence, but I think the salary-schedule explanation is more charitable.  In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind  a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?   Consider: we *know* that the Braves are about the strongest team in baseball right now, even with Olson and Lemke and Nixon and Bream in the lineup.  They have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has. It actually makes some sense to say \"rather than making our team marginally better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly, let\\'s go ahead and compete this year with what we have, and then bring up the studs only as we *have* to, so that we\\'ll still have them under reserve three years from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions.\"  Is it fair to the young players?  No.  Does it make organizational sense?  I think it does.  Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them for their decisions.  I mean, please don\\'t tell me how to run my business.  Especially when I\\'m being successful.   C:\\tI could make it 107 or 108 wins if you let me bring up Lopez.  S:\\tListen, Bobby.

How\\'s that?  I\\'m sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal substance.  Hey.  That\\'s a joke.  Don\\'t get offended.  Please.)   Hey, I\\'d love to be wrong about this.  If you think it\\'s unlikely, I\\'d love to know why.  Don\\'t cite anybody\\'s innate ethical rectitude, though, unless you know them personally.   Well, I can\\'t cite anyone\\'s ethical rectitude because I don\\'t know what it means.  :)  But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then that\\'s what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that it\\'s a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I don\\'t.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.  I don\\'t know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she\\'s a woman, everybody on the face of the earth thinks it\\'s great that she\\'s getting an opportunity to ump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of roast beef, you\\'d see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires.  I\\'ve never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that\\'s how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn\\'t promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though. I enjoy watching Toronto fans suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-)  Scot.

Something else to consider:  Alomar\\'s H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga\\'s was .486-.424 and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.

I know it\\'s very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let\\'s give credit where credit is due.  It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris. Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the  other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can\\'t remember exactly). Also, let\\'s not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save  the bullpen every fifth day.  If he didn\\'t help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series.  His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer\\'s (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games.  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good as he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters \"get themseleves out\" I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out  trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a  veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.  Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let\\'s not change history to suit the present.    BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a  veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more can he be embarrassed?

I definitely do.  That\\'s why I don\\'t like going to see games played on artificial turf :-)  The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches.  And while it\\'s true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this is only true when they don\\'t become extra-long.  Well, your idea of \"interesting\" differs from mine.  I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they\\'re attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game.  Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.  One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time.  You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it\\'s going to go on until four in the morning.

Sit him down for a game, and he might get a hit the next night.  But let him play, and what is he thinking about?  Getting hits, driving in runs?  No, he\\'s worried if he\\'s going to get that 30 stolen bases, or that 100th career home run.  He appears to have no learning curve. He never figured out how to play third base (what a fiasco).  He still plays the outfield with his legs.  He\\'s lucky he\\'s so fast, because it enables him to outrun his mistakes (but, as I suggested earlier in the season, it looks to me like he\\'s slowing down a little bit, or else every groundskeeper is watering the infield dirt a little extra).  Gant has had way too much of a chance already.  He may get hot again for a couple of months, but he\\'ll always revert to his true level.  Gant\\'s ML record  Age 28 this season.  Year   G   AB     BA   OBP   SLG   HR   SB  CS  rd Base Expt. year      In the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time approx 4.5 seasons.  Just looking at his hitting record, he\\'s had 2 seasons of OPS greater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF.  His season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B.  The move to third base explains a lot of his 1989.  When he returned as an OF, he began hitting again.  And of course, last year he slumped.  But no learning curve?  He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio.  As to his fielding, he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came up through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through position changes in the space of a year.  He\\'s an adequate OF, although not great, and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML level.  (I know you\\'re another long-term Braves fan :)  About playing 3B...IMO, that\\'s the 2nd most DIFFICULT position to field, after catcher.  At SS or 2B, you need more range and  speed, but at 3B, you\\'ve got to have quick reflexes and have  a GUN for an arm.  There are NO second chances at 3B, even when playing sandlot softball!  Granted, I\\'d still put my best overall infielder at SS, but that\\'s because he gets more chances, not because the job is harder.  It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3B.  But maybe that\\'s because the supply of \"natural\" 3B is scarce.  Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well, and works hard to improve.  You don\\'t get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work.  Now, whether he\\'s been overdoing it these days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat. But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential, I\\'d much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not trying hard enough.  You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult; but at that age I don\\'t believe you can teach hustle.  All that said, I don\\'t think I\\'d sign Gant to another long-term contract.  He\\'s 28 now, and I think he\\'s free-agent eligible in 2 years, when he\\'ll be 30.  Given his career curve and limitations, I wouldn\\'t expect him to last much past 35 as a ML ballplayer.  He might surprise me here, but Atlanta\\'s got some talent on the farm, and I\\'d rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et al.

Alright, that\\'s enough. I\\'ve suffered with all kinds of insults (as typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn\\'t drawing enough walks.  What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? You can hardly claim that he is \"hurting his team\".  It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP. That\\'s on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks. The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he\\'s has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB\\'s I\\'d be convinced that there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I\\'d not only be amazed but I\\'d make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game. But what do 45 AB\\'s prove?

Well, in a word, no. How significant is Galarraga\\'s average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If he\\'d had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play, he\\'d be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next game he\\'s all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let\\'s talk then.  If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), THEN* I would agree with you that he isn\\'t taking enough pitches. My comment that \"he isn\\'t paid to walk\" doesn\\'t mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it\\'s more along the lines of: he\\'s batting .400 and leading the league in RBI\\'s so what bloody difference does it make if he isn\\'t drawing  a lot of walks? Sheesh.  It\\'s history, Greg. Andres\\' history is that he doesn\\'t walk much because he swings at bad pitches, so his average isn\\'t very good. 45 AB\\'s doesn\\'t mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when there\\'s ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn\\'t changed. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never walks, but don\\'t bet the rent money on it.

Do you really want to see the Bruins against the Sabres umpteen times or would you rather see the Bruins and the Capitals in the secound round of playoffs?  There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.    The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round.  Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case.

They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesn\\'t mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.

Ville Siren\\'s slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period. The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then, during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47. Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund  skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3. Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since there was traffic in front, 4-3. Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3. Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone  with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot. The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot, showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side. But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.  All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best. Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations.  Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson- Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line. Stillman good on defense. Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros.  Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC. I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

You can try those if the local baseball teams aren\\'t playing at the same time, anyway.  According to this morning\\'s Post-Gazette:  The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am), unless the Pirates are playing.  When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by  WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight\\'s game.  In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by \"subscription tv\" only. To receive the games, you\\'ll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio broadcast team.    No word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald are both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the end of this season.  KBL President Bill Craig said he\\'d like to hire Lange and Steigerwald.

I think at this point there\\'s a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murray\\'s logical thought.  As outsiders, it\\'s fine for  us to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we\\'re all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he\\'ll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we\\'ll see how good of a GM he really is.  But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway.  I may not agree with everything you\\'ve said, but it\\'s been fun discussing it with you.

A columnist for the St.  Paul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic  Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen. Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \" Ice Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.

This is not to take anything away from Jaro, who had a  decent year (although it didn\\'t live up to the expectations of some).  Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style player.  He plays hard at all times, doesn\\'t disregard his defensive responsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his ice time.  Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a \"me first\" attitude. This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.  Throughout the year, Francis consistently recieved more ice time than Jagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When you add to that Jagr\\'s better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.   Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games).

Gerald,  people still have an axe to grind with this guy.  I CANNOT see him staying for long.  He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his price if Edmonton doesn\\'t.  But the people in Edmonton won\\'t budge, trust me on this one.  Edmonton has already ****** up its international airport, and surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks. It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.  Northlands won\\'t budge ccording to one of the board members, Bruce Campbell.  However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically  right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money.  I haven\\'t heard anything, BUT attendance at the Coliseum was the lowest this  year.  HINT!!HINT!!  Remeber what I said about a personal vendetta?  Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)  Gerald, don\\'t blame Sather.  This battle between the peole and Pocklington started in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky.    There were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was respectalbe( I use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are GOE!!

It (this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.  WHAT\\'S NEW  I am now running a World Wide Web archive of RIPEM information.  It does not contain much of anything that isn\\'t available elsewhere, but it has convenient pointers to the most current version of this FAQ and some other stuff.  The URL is \"http://cs.indiana.edu/ripem/dir.html\".  This month\\'s version has a fair amount of new pointers to information on patents and stuff like that.  I\\'ve also reordered a few things to have a more sensible ordering.

If you want real legal advice, talk to a real lawyer, preferably one with experience in patent law, export regulations, or whatever area of law is in question.  LIST OF QUESTIONS  What is RIPEM?

Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? What is PGP? What about RPEM? What is MIME? What is TIS/PEM? I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS   What is RIPEM?  RIPEM is a (not yet complete, but useful) implementation of Privacy Enhanced Mail .  RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by PEM: disclosure protection optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See: \"What is PEM?\")  RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan . Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.  The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7.  How can I get RIPEM?  RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the README file that this law not be violated:  Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM.  Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM.  RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping distribute it.  RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its \"home site\" on ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree.  Will RIPEM run on my machine?  Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected, and help of users is invited.  Will RIPEM work with my mailer?  Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs.  If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.  What is RSA?  RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  Note that the \"message\" sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real plaintext. (See \"What is DES?\")  Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message See \"What is a fingerprint, like MD5?\") is encrypted with the sender\\'s private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving authority, can use the sender\\'s public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered.  RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information also may be in sci.crypt.  What is DES?  DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA.  RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient\\'s public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, allowing the recipient to recover the DES key.  DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability.  What is a fingerprint, like MD5?  MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, instead of signing the entire message with the sender\\'s private key, only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication.  MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example, RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy.  MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator.  MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321.  There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true.  What is PEM?  PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115.  RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.  What\\'s this about distributing and authenticating keys?  For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a \"bad guy\" convinces her that his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read.  RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server, the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist.  Isn\\'t it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM?  This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310, the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key cryptography.  This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive available via FTP: ftp.uu.net:/doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are compressed with a patented algorithm.)  What about RSADSI/PKP?  RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S. patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents:  Cryptographic Apparatus and Method Diffie-Hellman\")............................... No. 4,200,770  Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (\"Hellman-Merkle\").................... No. 4,218,582  Cryptographic Communications System and Method (\"RSA\")................................... No. 4,405,829  Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus and Method (\"Hellman-Pohlig\").................... No. 4,424,414  PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.) PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents.  RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its author\\'s desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography. However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing code.  RIPEM even won the \"Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992\" award.  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar?  RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people\\'s keys.  This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.  What is PGP?  PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA.  A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM:  PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without a direct network connection.  RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself.  RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its patents to \"make, use or sell\" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without either a license or written permission.  (See: \"DISCLAIMER\") See: \"What about RSADSI/PKP?\")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but it hasn\\'t happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User\\'s Guide:  In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,  you shouldn\\'t actually run PGP on your computer, because Public Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is contraband.  Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places.  Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Unfortunately, it\\'s not distributed separately from the program, which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to liability concerns.  What about RPEM?  RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM.  Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons.  RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.  What is MIME?  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter.  What is TIS/PEM?  Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don\\'t know much more than that.  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...  You may wish to check the companion post \"ripem-attacks\" which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM\\'s security and what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM\\'s main \"weak area\" is probably key distribution. </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/sci.crypt/15168\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/sci.crypt/15168\"> From: so@eiffel.cs.psu.edu (Nicol C So) Subject: Re: Source of random bits on a Unix workstation Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 16:37:39 GMT Lines: 19  In article  bet@sbi.com (Bennett Todd @ Salomon Brothers Inc., NY ) writes: This came up because I decided to configure up MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 security for X11R5.

The new cryptography scheme was  announced today by the White House and the National Institute  for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the  technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman  acknowledged that the National Security Agency , the super- secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the  encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.  According to NIST, the technical specifications and the  Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To  open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today  filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests  with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security  Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption  plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the  Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to  open the development of non-military computer security standards  to public scrutiny and to limit NSA\\'s role in the creation of  such standards.  CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in  developing the so-called \"digital signature standard\" , a  communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for  government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA  lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first  time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.   NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying  the classification of records concerning its creation of the  DSS.  David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the  administration\\'s apparent commitment to the privacy of  electronic communications, as reflected in today\\'s official  statement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned  the propriety of NSA\\'s role in the process and the apparent  secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from  public scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the  development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital  that standards designed to protect personal privacy be  established openly and with full public participation.  It is  not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of  secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to  play a leading role in the development process.\"   CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer  industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of  technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and  maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,  Massachusetts and Washington, DC.

I think this is poor choice.   The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors: they audit how people\\'s civil liberties are administered.  Traditionally, auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good reason.  When I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view, but wouldn\\'t tell us how to fix it.  I always figured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix the problem.  Then I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason. Auditors don\\'t like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The auditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor\\'s job.  Taking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar. Suppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU\\'s part, a key half gets away that shouldn\\'t, and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court. But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.  There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one place where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum was kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.  I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again today, he better be able to produce yesterday\\'s checks so that they can be destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest.  As always, my opinions are my own.

In particular, his administration will place strict controls on data formats and protocols, and require the registration of so-called ``cryptographic keys,\\'\\' in the hope of denying drug dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  Clinton said the approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground economic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.\\'\\' Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last November, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of urgency about fighting the drug menace.

I posted them from an account called \\'clipper.\\'  I also created an alias called \\'clipper\\' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography, security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand.  The \\'clipper\\' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is  not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.  While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this, I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the \\'clipper\\' alias - I\\'ve already apologized to them for what\\'s happened.

I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylinders that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they\\'re called Cooling Towers\\' but what the heck do they cool?  Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890\\'s (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.  Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\" turbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).

When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor. There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.  Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.  John Eaton hp-vcd!johne   I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over. I don\\'t like nuclear powerplants but i think it\\'s not fair to tell such storys\" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to: st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine. It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry  conventional. And if you\\'ve already visited any condensation- powerstation you\\'l have seen the cooling towers too. If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\\'ll find a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\\'ve an temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one  side and need to cool down the steam \\'till you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the  energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\" steam on the other side you\\'ll loose much more of the energy. And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of energy that carnot will give them. The cooling towers are for cooling the steam ! The vapor you\\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation, because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent radioactive pollution of the environment !  nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature- Reactors  they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\\'ll have lot\\'s of problems with the boiler\\'s steel. That\\'s because at this temperature the metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast. This is only for BWR\\'s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.   rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\\'t be 0.75 mRem at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\\'ll still have mRem.

My question is:  Is there a good relay/relay circuit that I can use for switching audio, so that there will be *NO* noise of any kind on the audio lines.   I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!  Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching transistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?  Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)  As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before break and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!  Lots of luck!

C. Bowman) writes:  I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that it proudly proclaims \"8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING\" on the box.  Now while I think I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete \"samples\" exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor), I don\\'t understand this \"8 TIMES\" business...  It seems to me that when I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs said \"4 TIMES\" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I\\'m getting senile?  If I\\'m not, then what good does it do for the player to take samples at a higher rate?    The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person\\'s heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks that weren\\'t there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code.  In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response) filter.  I\\'d guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out there know the real answer?  I\\'d say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs.   Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.  Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll-off that isn\\'t so sharp.   It\\'s too bad that they charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.  I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are built to a price spec, and that spec says \"cheap as possible!\".

I can probably make suggestions, assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea, legally, to tamper with copy protection.

Matt  I have written a program and I want to market it.  I would like certain degree of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the  cooperations.   I know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method, however, my  software is going to cost only $15.00, so I can not afford that. Also, at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my software. Well, I guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me.  However, I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software.   Off course, I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since they can develope a better program anyway.  With highest regards, Babak   Sehari.     One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask you for a word from page x, line y, and word z, but this is pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program, and some self-rewriting code to confuse some people.  Also, make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger.  Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk, just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here, you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph. Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in some random sector.  Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the opposite of what you want.  Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it requests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other things, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program.  Tell them the program is \"VIRUS SECURE\", and remember, you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.  I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.

A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape with single-frame messages.  It aired on a few stations, but a tech at one station, previewing the tape, noticed a flicker and looked at the tape frame-by-frame to find the \"defect\".  Big flap.  FCC notified. Commercial pulled.  Press reports. Embarassed ad agency.  You could probably find the press reports via Dialog or Nexis if you wanted.

My question is: Is this an unusual form of Menangitis?  How is it transmitted? How does it work (ie. how does it kill so quickly)?  There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age: in adults pneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the \"meningococcus\", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I don\\'t have time for a more detailed reply.

Wrong.  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink? Milligrams worth.  Compare that to a glass of milk.  Do you know how much glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that added by the use of MSG?

They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.

ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.       New Program Announcement   ########################    JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:  TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friend\\'s case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.

The threat is not from bad genes, but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes which are the units of genetics.  We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that future technology has to offer.  For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid Mary.  We must expand the public-health laws to include quarantine of people with harmful memes.  They should not be allowed to infect other people with their memes against genetically-engineered food, electromagnetic fields, and the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters. </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/sci.med/58887\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/sci.med/58887\"> From: nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) Subject: Re: Post Polio Syndrome Information Needed Please !!!

Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Stern\\'s daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundation\\'s mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.

About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor  suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.  While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being  manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is  persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term.    My questions are:   Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the levels of pain?  Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?  Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?   Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.   Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:  John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  text / graphics  input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file   automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in \"standard\" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.   If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,  Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis , have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections . Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs   This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious  Diseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation  that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington  On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome  and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.  As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS  Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52  had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of  symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372  reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312  reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144  were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  range: 0-74 years). Idaho  Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December  through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California  In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.  Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.  Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.  Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of  the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada  On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with  onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After  SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.  Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:  years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- Other Investigation Findings  During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11  lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.  A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.  Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers . This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated . Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7  that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.  Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection . The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.  This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar .  When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.  E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can  contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.  Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration  has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).  Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.  coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer  -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently .  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.  The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals  were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)   In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).  Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.  An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  CI=68.9-78.1).  Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.  Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-   Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease  Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders .  Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons .  In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally . In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking . Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.  The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) . Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events .

GB> I hope you meant \"inarguably\".  Given the choice, I would rather argue .  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.  Working on a salary, however, I would rather not fill my office with patients holding their heads in pain.  SLMR 2.1 .

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn\\'s and Ulcerative Colitis.   Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has now changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be  important.

The change in environment can cause problems.  Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of the body as easily.  The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points.  Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days. The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even young people find the change unsettling.  Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have tried a \\'rapid transit\\' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early.  Anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.  Haloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow release formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons.

I would appreciate any comments about this and other new\\' technology for hearing aids.  The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new \\'programmable\\' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in \\'noisy\\' situations.  The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness\\'.  This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the \\'too loud\\' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff).  Aids with simple compressors don\\'t descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor \\'compress\\' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations.

I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.  Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound.  Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn\\'t compare them \\'head to head\\' with the Widex. Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.  The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the difference!

She was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all this time.  During her most recent doctor\\'s appointment at her parents\\' HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney. When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle.  She couldn\\'t help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something.  She is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained.  When nobody would, she got worried. Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until August or so.  It is now April... She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids.  But she has to go to classes.  She wonders why they have given her no medicine.  She plans to call back her doctor\\'s office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions.  But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care.  She does plan to get a second opinion, too.   I will pass info on to her.  It never hurts to get information from more than one source.    You can e-mail me or post.  Thanks.

Serious business.  They wanted to do a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite.  I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT.   She was in tears.  Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her.  To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine, without any explanation.  Imagine this.  You worried you may have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you\\'re being put into this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you.  I believe this is inexcusable.   She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with annoyance and anger.  Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV catheter.  Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain.  The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation.  Is there anything I can do about these pigs ?  I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out.  And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. But this is simply no excuse.  Their purpose for existing is to help sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. Fortunately my friend is fine.  But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all.  They have cancer and that sort of thing.  They don\\'t need this kind of shit.  Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at NCMH.

He was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we are beginning to wonder how often \"more often\" really is, whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are, and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day care and we think it\\'s great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny.  Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?  How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on home care vs. day care?  Does being sick \"build immunity\" (leading to less illness later), does it make kids \"weaker\" (leading to more illness later), or does it not have any long term effect?  Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects?  How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal, and what does one do about it?  Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?  Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated.  Thanks a lot.

In general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent between these networks, and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special \\'servers\\'.  The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.  One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below.  A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\', and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted.  Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS  SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the International Space University (in only its second change of management in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body should be in the format \\'subscribe space John Public\\') to join.

When you trash people, how am I supposed to read that as \\'trashing people is bad\\'?  F Gee, funny that you get it now, then?  Deliberate obtuseness, perhaps?  Fred\\'s issue #1;  Nick\\'s alleged trashing of others ***  I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently, instead of \\'allegorically\\'.  That was my point all along, Fred.  Not only do you do the same thing on the net (honestly reporting your ideas on matters of policy and projects in space), but your response was just baiting, not even part of a debate.  I have yet to see Nick enter into anything remotely resembling \"a debate\".  I see him flame anyone or anything who disagrees with The One True Szabo Plan; I see him attacking people, calling them \"lazy bastard\" because they had the temerity to disagree with the Almight Nick; I see him questioning peoples ethics, again because they had the temerity to disagree with Lord God Szabo.  But debate?  BWAAaaahhhaaaa.  I\\'m glad you can laugh, since your ratio of debate/insult is about the same.  Not even close, Tommy, and generally only when I\\'m dealing with someone like Nick.  I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last point.  Why don\\'t you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective point-of-view?  And, as usual, you defend your insults with \"he started it.\"  \"Yeah, I took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.\"  \"So what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.\"  Besides that, I think it\\'s still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.  Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  \"I never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you gave it to me.\"  Make up yer mind, Fred!  I\\'m not convinced that people are necessary in all parts of every space- based process, and your response doesn\\'t tell me a thing about the reasons why you think they should be, except to impune the motives of the person with a divergent opinion.  Who said I think they should be, Tommy?  Show me a note where I said that and I\\'ll eat this terminal.    ****See below, Fred****  Fred, I cocluded that you did, since you took issue with it.  The fact that my conclusion was incorrect, i.e. that you were taking issue with something different, is evidence that your communication style is confusing.  Or evidence that your reading and comprehension style are inadequate.  First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly interpreting you a second time, and I\\'m stupid for it.  I just can\\'t win, can I, Fred?  You\\'ve got a great point here somewhere, it\\'s just that between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.  Please quote the \\'it\\' I took issue with.  I believe you will see (if you look) that what I was and am taking issue with is Mr Szabo\\'s idea that the manned program should be scrapped until such time as his toaster-based infrastructure is finished.  All Hail the Szabo Plan!  Fred issue #2;  Nick\\'s alleged meaning ***  Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick\\'s, or you would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that \"people aren\\'t required in all parts of all space processes\", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as \"People are required in all parts of all space processes.\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I\\'m so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it\\'s one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)  The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I\\'d only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that\\'s your job, Fred.  And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a \\'plan\\' that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone.  More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy?  No, no, I finally got it.  You don\\'t like the plan that Nick\\'s posts made you imagine.  And you don\\'t like Nick\\'s obnoxious behavior, even though it\\'s no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself.  If you have a problem with Nick\\'s delivery, address that.  The way you bait, you\\'re perpetuating the lack of discourse that you complain of.  No, Tommy, the \\'bait\\' is that which elicits the response.  *NICK* baits\\'; I just flame him for being an obnoxious fool.  I don\\'t really care who started it.  I read this list to get information and other\\'s views on the issues to which it was dedicated, not to be your Mom (He started it!  No, he did!) or to hear about why Nick is a very bad guy.  If you think flaming is bad, stop flaming, or at least get to the point in the first post, instead of explaining yourself all the time.  That\\'s nice, Tommy.  When you pay me to post to the net you can complain about not getting your money\\'s worth.  Perhaps if you weren\\'t deliberately?) too thick to get the point the first time I wouldn\\'t have to waste time \"explaining [myself] all the time\"?  Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?  I think it\\'s neat how all this criticism from you started after your fatherly\\' admonitions to me about how such things should be handled outside Usenet were somewhat rebuffed.  Being a little hypocritical, Tommy (to go with the immaturity)?  Or is this just the pique of a net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he *thought* was new and hence could be \\'instructed\\' -- Tommy, I saw you come on the net).  Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. If you had seen me on the net first, you\\'d remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It\\'s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that\\'s no worse than your own.  Let\\'s see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn\\'t, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn\\'t.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  Net.ghod wannabe\"?  Naturally, Fred, you\\'ve correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn\\'t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you\\'d bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn\\'t clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I\\'ll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I\\'m stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you\\'re happy.

I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical.

Mitchell March 23, 1993  INTRODUCTION:  In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.  Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.  This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: tele-operations and virtual reality research radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation astronomy and space planetariums and science centers art and theater bbs and online network users software and game developers manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains children the child in all of us  LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:  A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.  The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.  Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.  The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.  Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.  Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.  By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.  PLAN OF ACTION:  The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.  A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.  A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.  The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!  CONCLUSION:  EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment.

I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :   The Microlight Solar Sail   Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.  Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.  When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\"  Well Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?  Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.  It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.  It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.  Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.  As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.  Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: See charts)  I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s and 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!  But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.  I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]  I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\\'s idea -- Any Takers? </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/sci.space/61053\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/sci.space/61053\"> From: henry@zoo.toronto.edu (Henry Spencer) Subject: Re: Moonbase race, NASA resources, why?

Why must it be a US Government Space Launch Pad? Directly I mean...  In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don\\'t have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project.

It also has the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle isn\\'t reusable, it\\'s salvagable).  I am thinking of how DC-X will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at  supersonic speeds.    The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.  How much in DC-X is redundant?  That\\'s the real question.  The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available thrust and still land safely.

If the DC series fails to make orbit, it will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do need to do to build SSTO.  But, DC-X will still have failures.  It is the nature of aerospace R&D.    Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn\\'t. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn\\'t.  It\\'s successors are not slated to be passenger carrying.    Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will carry passengers.

The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\" For all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.

In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It\\'s driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how  to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses I\\'ve been to were participatory prayers.    Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it\\'s being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn\\'t a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get \\'em in and get \\'em out\".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn\\'t follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.}  Tim Rolfe rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe@junior.dsu.edu RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/soc.religion.christian/20529\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/soc.religion.christian/20529\"> From: chrstie@ccu.umanitoba.ca (William John M.

Also, \"there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow it blindly?   Do the words \"Question Authority\" mean anything to you? I defy any theist to reply.        Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \"Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,\" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man\\'s alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton\\'s head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.

Post it only if you think it of general interest.  Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may find it relevant.  A listmember asks:  What makes common-law marriages wrong?  A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is nothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by a preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings.  There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the West) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage, and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.  HOWEVER!  The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife, forsaking all others, till death do them part.  The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be clear about whether a commitment has been made.  Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows, etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live together. After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it was great while it lasted, but I think it\\'s time to move on. She says: What are you talking about? He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger. She says: But you can\\'t. We are married! He says: What are you talking about? We never got married. She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love. You said: \"My love for you is as deep as the ocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours, utterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble breath will utter your name. My...\" He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When a man is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that. You mustn\\'t take them literally.  And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record. The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other things) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom, if anybody, and vice versa. The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with property rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom. Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don\\'t want their daughters seduced and abandoned. Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment, or just \"poetry.\" And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.  Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when Christians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that the probate judge\\'s interpretation of them is not at all what you intended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long haul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\" and \"till death do us part.\"  This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic that hasn\\'t?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each other and are living together, isn\\'t that marriage in the eyes of God?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status if they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce? Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk out on? \" The original questioner said: \"Good grief, I never thought of that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says, \"We don\\'t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother.  At this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my mate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment, \\'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death us do part.\\' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\" To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver\\'s license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence of dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.  Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks: At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I answer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for better or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted such an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?

Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian \"cult\" from the Presbyterian \"church\"?  Doctrinal differences don\\'t answer the question, IMHO, so don\\'t use them as an answer.   As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus\\'s disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges don\\'t always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldn\\'t be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.

This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They  then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn\\'t come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, he\\'d come out.  He finished the first one, but didn\\'t do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didn\\'t come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.  I think it\\'s really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well.

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.  First of all, \"ceremonial law\" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  Paul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?

It says that \"The Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.\"  This was defined by a Papal statement in 1950, though it had certainly been believed by some before that.  Like the Immaculate Conception, this is primarily a Roman Catholic doctrine, and like it, it has no direct Biblical support.  Note that Catholics do not believe in \"sola scriptura\". That is, they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of Christian knowledge.  Thus the fact that a doctrine has little Biblical support is not necessarily significant to them.  They believe that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church, and also that it can be revealed to the Church.  I\\'m not interested in yet another Catholic/Protestant argument, but if any Catholics can tell us the basis for these beliefs, I think it would be appropriate.  --clh]  In the Bible, there are a lot of instances where God speaks to people, where a person just \"came to know\" some piece of information, where a person walks off into the desert for \"40 days\", etc. With all of God\\'s power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it. The Bible \"ends\" with the book of Revelations. But does God\\'s reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God\\'s messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I\\'ve gotten from the past from this group, it\\'s very hard to get the point across.

They\\'re still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God\\'s existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is \"approved\" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that\\'s a bit too late, isn\\'t it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (\"coming to know\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ\\'s wounds. And they don\\'t heal. And doctor\\'s don\\'t know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I\\'m sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It\\'s free. Find out why they\\'re happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not \"members only\" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC\\'s believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we\\'re told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why \"not everything is in the Bible\". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God\\'s churches will unite. I\\'m not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn\\'t worry about the \"versus\" part. Just do God\\'s work. That\\'s all that matters.

An english translation of this can be found in: The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance\", J. M. Wilson London, 1923).  Another work that might be useful is: The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933; reprinted 1970).  This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don\\'t know if it actually contains an english translation or not.)  Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is: The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).  The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early \\'80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone\\'s interested.)  Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if you\\'re interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in: A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible Society, 1971).  Metzger\\'s book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).  In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes: An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full report (with an English translation) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ... Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).  I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the differences are between the long and the short forms.  Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is usually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).  As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.  To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main difference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.  The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is  that neither text represents purely the \"authentic\" version,  each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however,  the variant in the Alexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.

I (personally) have never heard of anything being attributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is, no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven, immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to Mary.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our doctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a  significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only source of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred  traditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early  generation that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul, etc. etc.  It wasn\\'t until the reformation that these doctrines were called into question.

FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS                          ISSN 1018-144X  PRAYING FOR JUSTICE by Peter Hammond)  To those involved in ministering to Christians suffering persecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of comfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or crime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God has entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms.   THE IMPRECATORY PSALMS  Early in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for judgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them. Prayers such as: Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for his wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly motivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the wicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who suffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You encourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)  Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your wrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O Lord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O Judge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\" Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.\\'\" 58:6-11  Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray for God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?  The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies. Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against His enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\" and \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots destruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise deceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5- With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot against those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors.\" 5:5-6.  To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares: Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5; Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who go on in their sins\" 68:21.  And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\" to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow down to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows the power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due You. \" 90:11  Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include imprecations (prayers invoking God\\'s righteous judgement upon the wicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church. However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common.   PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS  Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church. I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven pray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation   The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino Neto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola. He boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won\\'t be a Bible or a church left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto. Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in Moscow.  In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer: A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack. Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in fact carried out. But the next day when the official was medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal cancer. He died shortly afterwards. On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car crash the very next day. When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation, the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship. They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20  Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the antiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of Romania.  Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora Machel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the 1960\\'s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly Marxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in Mozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled, some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians, including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to concentration camps - most were never seen again.  A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in Mozambique, Machel\\'s Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa\\'s boundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and published. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor, but He had also saved a country from persecution.  In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27 year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian country.  It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots, declared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox\\'s prayers than of an army of ten thousand\".  On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa this Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.  The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people were murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other victims. Indeed the SA government, the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were unbanned!  Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973, Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe  the ANC\\'s \"military wing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword will die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.  After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly declared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told him that I was a Christian and, while I didn\\'t hate him, I did hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God would remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist.  Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani to repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against unrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer, within months of these public prayers for God to stop these killers of preborn babies.  Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted: When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any - even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory prayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did our Lord (Matt 11:20-24).  What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be? Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory Psalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company):  Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly in teaching men to know God. The New Testament  quotes the Old Testament  over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT are from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50 times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.   Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?  Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus\\' teaching that we should love our enemies. \"  Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares: All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \" see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).  The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of God.  Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God have led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to \"clean up\" God\\'s Word according to their own ideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for His Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the authority of God\\'s Word (like Eve\\'s original sin of listening to Satan\\'s question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").  The Psalms are part of God\\'s revelation of Himself and His attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the authoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\" for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about Himself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles used as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.  CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially Ps 109): Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would speak to us therein. \"  The rejection of any part of God\\'s Word is a rejection of the giver of that Word, God Himself.   Who is praying these Psalms?  Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually spoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at the Last Supper.  On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient authority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own words - the words of the Lord\\'s Anointed - which as David\\'s Son He truly was. Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5 My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1  In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on the day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so! Matt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, \\'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers\\'. \" Ps 6:8  In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said these words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22 directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having spoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed Christ is speaking in the Psalms.  Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in all the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again to execute Judgement on the wicked. David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a prototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30: being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ. \" David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in his words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah spoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by Christ. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His forerunner David.  The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of God, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion for the wronged.   But what about the Psalms of repentance?  Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with the sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for which He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the substitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah   God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21  In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others. All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the imprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy His enemies.  These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of King Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God\\'s Word is revealed upon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God\\'s way of forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses of God.  He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a reality when He declares to those on His left: Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41  All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God\\'s Kingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone will reign forever! With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \" Rev 19 : 15   Are Jesus\\' prayers contradictory?  What about Jesus\\' command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us (Matt 5:44)?  Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives sin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement on those who disobey His Gospel.  God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10  Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on earth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot God.  Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations. Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \" Matt 23  In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His betrayal by Judas.  We also need to acknowledge that Christ\\'s prayers of blessing are not for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only praying to the elect of God - those who have: obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God\\'s Word ... and have believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the message of God\\'s kingdom will be judged.)   May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?  Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say: \\'Curses, maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground\\' . \"  To pray tor the extension of God\\'s kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. \"  Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness. *  There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church cannot exclude hatred tor satan\\'s kingdom from its love for God\\'s kingdom. God\\'s kingdom cannot come without satan\\'s kingdom being destroyed. God\\'s will cannot be done on earth without the destruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of evil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.  Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot together\" against God and His people: Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O Lord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground. \"  The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5) provides a vivid example of God\\'s judgement on the wicked. Sisera cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those prayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot... All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \" Judges 4:15-16  The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of the head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As you did to Sisera ...\"   The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience  The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God: If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law until you are destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ... so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \" Deuteronomy 28:58-63  The covenant God made with His people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27 records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account: The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice: Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing detestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman\\'s hands - and sets it up in secret. \" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother... Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour\\'s boundary stone... Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads... Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow... Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly... Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by carrying them out. Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26  The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the Lord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22  See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-    How can we preach these prayers?  The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders. Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander- in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we expect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not hear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him onto the battlefield?  Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church\\'s Commander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general\\'s orders. The pastor\\'s charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army. There\\'s no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesn\\'t agree with his Commander\\'s strategy.  When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching mission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God\\'s Kingdom (Lk that is, to announce that people must submit to God\\'s rule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we must consider what He said they should do if their message were rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against God\\'s rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its \\'streets and say, \\'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near\"\\' Luke 10:11.  What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that town (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great authority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to Me; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects him who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor calling down God\\'s curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion against God\\'s authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of His servants.  We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the Prince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable.  Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is that God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he reap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant breakers is real.  The \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms includes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our own, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record Christ\\'s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As Christ is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will answer the psalmist\\'s prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the final day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when He will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\" Luke 19:27.  A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God\\'s kingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle- readiness also involves \"pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.  Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not call on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.  To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for God\\'s justice. Those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers.  Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against them. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps   Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army of God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He has given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people nf God to destroy evil.  If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or undermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword anew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of Jesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.

I\\'d appreciate some support for this statement.  I\\'m not sure it really makes sense to me.  I define faith as \"belief, in the abscense of evidence\". I also include in \"evidence\" past experiences. Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god. From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith. It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word faith\") that I find intellectually dishonest.  The ambiguity of religious beliefs, an unwillingness to take Pascal\\'s Wager,   I\\'ve heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal\\'s wager?  Pascal\\'s wager goes something like this: Premise #1: Either there is or there isn\\'t a God. Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing. Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn\\'t matter because death is death, anyway. Conclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.  Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is, Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have heard theists referred to as \"99% atheists\" because they believe in their god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of this is \"what if I pick the wrong god?\" Suddenly, the odds don\\'t look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god\\'s version of hell.  Do I sound \"broken\" to you?  I don\\'t know.  You point out that your mother\\'s treatment upset you, and see inconsistencies in various religions.  I\\'m not sure if that constitutes broken-ness or not.   It certainly consititutes  disillusionment.  I don\\'t see how \"disillusionment\" enters into it. You see, I presented my mother\\'s treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother\\'s version of Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the right one. I\\'m still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though, it\\'s based on the evidence of past experience) that I\\'ll never find a religion which has all the answers. Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you\\'re going to find. Someone else mentioned that critisism isn\\'t going to make me think any more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive critisism will turn me off. No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza.

I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\"  The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again, regenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant--through the power of the word.  The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision. Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of God\\'s covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be performed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this, and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.

If this has already actually been posted, please fill free to flush this copy.  --N]  From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of the Acts of the Apostles can be found?  A english translation of this can be found in: The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance\", J. M. Wilson London, 1923).  Another work that might be useful is: The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933; reprinted 1970).  This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don\\'t know if it actually contains an english translation or not.)  Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is: The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).  The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early \\'80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone\\'s interested.)  Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if you\\'re interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in: A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible Society, 1971).  Metzger\\'s book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).  In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes: An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full report (with an English translation) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ... Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).  I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the differences are between the long and the short forms.  Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is usually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).  As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.  To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main difference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems to be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.  The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is  that neither text represents purely the \"authentic\" version,  each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however,  the variant in the Alexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.

It was a pleasure to read them.\"  MY REPLY... You are welcome, Zane.  Zane... I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you. I mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you have read the book you\\'ve been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your Christian life?\"  MY REPLY... When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith movement.  It was easy.  I wasn\\'t grounded in the Word of God and sound doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others. Consequently, I began receiving Hagin\\'s monthly magazine (and they still send it to me), and also Copeland\\'s (also, still sent to me). It wasn\\'t until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith: The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!  My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith \"cult\" in my area - it\\'s leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and has now fallen into atheism.  I\\'m still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).  The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been a `follower\\' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers\\' heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I\\'ve been able to talk to him at length about these issues.  The leader of the Women\\'s Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan\\'. Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as my lending CIC to people in the church.  I\\'m well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies. What heresies? A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became one with him. B. Jesus\\' death on the cross wasn\\'t enough to atone. C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling over Him there. D. Jesus was `born-again\\' in hell. E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after the resurrection. F. We are gods.  These are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings upon request.  Zane... Or what does it do for you?  Is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word/faith movement which you\\'d been contemplating joining for so long, but now that you\\'ve read the book, you\\'ve been saved from all of that?\"  MY REPLY... It wasn\\'t _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me; it was a booklet by Swaggart that I mentioned above.  But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous documentation and insights.  Zane... I don\\'t have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un- profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting.\"  MY REPLY... Why do you call it \"heresy hunting\"?  \"Hunting\" implies it isn\\'t readily accessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in Christendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.  Hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined.  Fred Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA.  Doesn\\'t sound like much \"hunting\" is needed.  It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error.  I gave some verses to you before. More can be given.  Most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal, practical) in the churches.  The early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy.  It\\'s not a new thing.  Remember Luther?  Zane... I would like to point out though, that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un- documented opinion.\"  MY REPLY... If you can provide documentation, it would be appreciated. Read Ephesians 4:11-16, esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes disunity and immaturity in the body.  EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting....  Disunity, contrary to popular opinion, isn\\'t caused by exposing error; it\\'s caused by error.  Zane... There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as documenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would suggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End.\"  MY REPLY... Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last.  Let\\'s examine his admonitions to Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...  TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.  TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.  TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.  TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.  TI 3:12-17 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.  TI 4:2-5 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.  TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.  Zane... The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep, with many tears, the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves.\"  MY REPLY... ACT 20:26-31 \"Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. \"For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God. \"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood. \"For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. \"Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves. \"Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.  Zane... For all the warning Paul does, it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf....  - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him - everyone in Asia wasn\\'t it ?\"  MY REPLY... Paul mentioned names...  TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.  TI 1:15 This you know, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.  TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.  TI 4:10 for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica--Crescens for Galatia, Titus for Dalmatia.  TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. May the Lord repay him according to his works. You also must beware of him, for he has greatly resisted our words.  So did John...  JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will call to mind his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words. And not content with that, he himself does not receive the brethren, and forbids those who wish to, putting them out of the church.  Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines...  REV 2:14-16 \"But I have a few things against you, because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality. \"Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. \\'Repent, or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth.  REV 2:20-23 \"Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. \"And I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent. Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. \"I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.  Zane... I question too, the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others.  Maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey, or barely cakes...with no worldly goods at stake, money to be made, or no reputations to maintain... I would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less.\"  MY REPLY... I won\\'t comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others. But even if they had bad motives, remember what Paul said...  PHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from good will: The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.  Zane... If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which you list - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines, I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the Cross.\"  MY REPLY... Please explain.  Zane... Secondly, I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships - which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church.\"  MY REPLY... If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media, then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure.  Unfortunately, heresy is being taught not just in Copeland\\'s church or Hagin\\'s or Hinn\\'s or Price\\'s, but all over the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It\\'s imperative that leadership be made aware of this, and CIC does just that.  Also, let\\'s examine a passage of Scripture... EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,  These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church, but for \"the body of Christ\". Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also a teacher - CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church. CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.  Also - CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.  EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;  Notice that the \"Five-Fold\" ministries are going to be around \"till\" the church is in \"unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man\".  This, I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns (see Cor. 13:9-12).  But God wants the body to continue on maturing.  What hinders maturity and unity of the body?  EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,  It\\'s clear that false doctrine, integrated into the church \"by the trickery of men\" causes  disunity [the thing we are striving for] and  spiritual immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine\".  The \"Five -Fold\" ministry, of which there does not appear to be clear Scriptural denominational boundaries (\"pastors\" appear responsible for their individual flock), is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their struggle to equip the body.  All believers are called to do this to a degree... JUD 1:3-4 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.  Zane... If you\\'ll notice, in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to Church and area to area, were the \"bad guys\" and they went after the \"good guy\" namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic.\"  MY REPLY... They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught!  Zane... Let\\'s face it, the wolves are here for a reason.  And we are here for the Reason.  And let\\'s hope the wolves become sheep, and the sheep, lambs.\"  MY REPLY... Yes! TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all,  able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if  God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, and  that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.

Some think it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows? Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less?  Paul mentions his \"thorn\" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2 Corinthians 12:7-9  And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; but he said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfectr in weakness.\"  He does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral problem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He ordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and his signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says, See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand,\" or else, \"See what a long letter I have written with my own hand.\" If the former translation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters larger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the Galatians (4:13-15),  You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.  Perhaps this last line means simply, \"You would have done anything for me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).\" But in that case, we would expect some wording like, \"If I had needed them.\" \"If it were possible\" sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes.  William Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific suggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had a malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.

It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, \"If you care to accept it\", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein- carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it is.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other topics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of reincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews today, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah Hurnard (\"Hinds Feet on High Places\") was told about it by a Rabbi she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine. Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this, whereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about  John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded but nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one way or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general of the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are  occasional indications that point to it.  As for the \"popular belief\" that Elijah would come again, it was more than  a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never  corrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought  that Jesus himself be he.

Funny, you\\'d think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)  It IS more easy to kill/injure someone with a gun than with a knife or a bat (as in baseball).  Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry. Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have.  I\\'ve spent a few years practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one though self-defense isn\\'t the reason I own one).  My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.  It\\'s not very wise to compare two completely different countries like USA and, let\\'s say, Island on issues like crime and violence.  Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren\\'t so naive after all?  Yes, the problem is  people committing crimes, not the tools beeing used, but 1) should be taken into concideration.  Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let\\'s make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault, assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.  We have a very strict gun-legislation in Norway, but until recently it was possible for enyone over 18 years to buy a shotgun. Shotguns are used mainly for hunting in Norway, but because it was so easy to accuire one, it was THE most used gun in crimes.  In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and shortly thereafter weapons weren\\'t quite so common.  I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I\\'m curious, though, were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just registering the shotgun?  And -unbelievable- the use of guns in crime fell..... There are now a new law against wearing long knives in public, and why should it be allowed ??  Come on down to honest Erik\\'s Used Swords!  Here\\'s a slightly-used short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!\"  Sorry, I couldn\\'t resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives, or is this really not a problem?  What I, as an scandinavian, have problems to understand is that  you (Americans) have a more liberal view on guns and violence than on nudity and sex. Try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder...  I\\'m all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I\\'m only a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing. Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become civilized with?  Yes, I know a little American history, but is it a civil/human right to have an assault gun in your home and/or an handgun in your car??  Yes.  We\\'re too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don\\'t identify ourselves as \"Americans\" first and foremost.  I\\'m rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage, whereas I suspect you couldn\\'t care less about that 2% Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good. In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I\\'d hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture we have is that we\\'re looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke low Dane,\" whereas others spoke \"high Dane.\"  It was shortly after World War II, as I remember, that \"low Dane\" was abolished so there was one common dialect.

I suppose that depends on how you define \\'vast\\' majority....

With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in  using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.

Every city and suburban police officer I\\'ve seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though I haven\\'t seen any Glock\\'s).   With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I\\'d like to put my two cents worth in.  While there\\'s nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a  large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob\\'s (I know, some people can\\'t stand him and think he\\'s full of bull, but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something  like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto\\'s are different, and that different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in  more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a certain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to  learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.   Define \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).  A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.  A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again. A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first, but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.  Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.   A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round.  I\\'m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you don\\'t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it\\'s very rare, but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time.   A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion, even one handed.  Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off.  Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.  The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always  take more time.  You also don\\'t have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later).     A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything about clearing it.  Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).   Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver.  There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training.  All common semi-auto\\'s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should say that this applies to all of the ones I\\'ve looked at.  For the DA semi\\'s it\\'s no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there\\'s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I\\'m not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and  shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.   Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR.  Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can\\'t figure out how it\\'s worse than a revolver for safety.  If you don\\'t pull the trigger it doesn\\'t go off.  I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you\\'d have problems when the hammer wasn\\'t there.   Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don\\'t know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot.  I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it\\'s a small one B^)).   Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a  wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don\\'t hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven\\'t hit what I\\'m aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5.  I have the poor man\\'s Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don\\'t hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don\\'t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.    What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police  prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....  mm\\'s are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto\\'s seem the rule for the street cop.  Don\\'t know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry the \"Highway Patrolman\".   ObPlea: Don\\'t flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they  introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.  Vincent, please don\\'t take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob\\'s book.

At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \"last used in Detroit in 48\". The text follows.  You did not merely claim that tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.    Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say I had been told they did fire their main guns.    You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing.  Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    Well, it\\'s not the main gun.\"  Gee, that\\'s only the entire point.  Are you now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?  I\\'ve heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"   I wasn\\'t wrong . . . I\\'ve heard those descriptions.  If you\\'re paying attention, I\\'ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here\\'s the entire post:  We haven\\'t used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948.   Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \"Black Day in July\".   Since you don\\'t dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the \\'67 riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news.  So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on: You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\\'re losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I\\'l take your side of this for a while.  You\\'re not scoring here, you\\'re boring here.   If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about it.   Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also heard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d assert that I claimed they were truth.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.  Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.  Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.  Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read this far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the account I cited.  John L.

Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some extent.... Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of  all the [masses?? -- editor barf -- Dan]  Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp.

Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 17:44:50 GMT Lines: 94  Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station, KTVB Channel 7.  Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.  Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.  Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.  The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley, who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in his dealings with Randy Weaver.  Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the White cause.\"  The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12- gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver is reported to have said that he could perform better work once his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 - over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).  The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that his \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead of the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver suspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in Spokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince Weaver otherwise.  The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki Weaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must have also been phone taps.  These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to make sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a case at all...\" according to the rules.  Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his wife\\'s voice on the tape.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect this trial is not explained.  Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound sustained in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that Harris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.  Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial.  Kenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue.   </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/talk.politics.guns/54394\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/talk.politics.guns/54394\"> From: cdt@sw.stratus.com (C.

But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical attention that the BD were not looking for trouble.  If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening chips for medical attention etc.  A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking ATF agents out of panic.

Clinton has admitted in front of news cameras that Janet Reno (the once and future Attorney General) gave him a full briefing of what was planned *before* they did it, and he gave her the go ahead.  Maybe, just possibly, that makes him a *teensy* bit responsible?   The FBI, CIA, BATF, etc. ARE federal agencies, you are correct.  But to think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then tell the Prez, who says, \"I knew all along\".  While this may not seem right, or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I\\'m not sure if they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave. Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from reaching its full potential.    You seem to make two points.  No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies   you mention, and since Koresh \"apparently\" has a different view point from your   Baptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious   persecution.  As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all?  Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.

It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business.    Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  How about someone at home?  Note that both are legal, and a lot of \"common\" people qualify for one or the other.  andy   Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I\\'m sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that I can\\'t carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don\\'t always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are \"running around in circles\" trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some- times.

I\\'d be interested in this particular definition of \"we.\"  It\\'s such a fluid pronoun.  BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no propaganda value there.  The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the BDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan.  The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little \\'country\\'. WRONG !  The BD were a paranoid little cult out in the middle of nowhere, which all of a sudden had their worst paranoid fears reinforced.  Joy.  They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were.  Yes, they probably should have, although how many paranoid nuts can say they held off the feds for 51 days?  If the BDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth.  The voting booth is highly over-rated.  People need to get up off their lazy butts more than every year or every two years.  Hell, most don\\'t even do that.  If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be so.  No, because \"we\" have decided that it doesn\\'t make enough difference to \"us\" to get up and do something.  That\\'s something, for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control bills at their local government.  Dozens of \"pro-gun\" speakers show up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.  Why?  Because it doesn\\'t matter who shows up, it matters who\\'s willing to scream afterwards.  And it isn\\'t that most people give a damn one way of the other, but that they don\\'t.  Nobody gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.  We get to vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years, we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI.

So...the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives?  Tell me Tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? Assuming that they are using civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it  further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... \"GETTING BACK\" GETTING EVEN\". It doesn\\'t make sense to shell the villages. The least it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of civilians.  If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon this.  When someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of popular sentiment, the topic arose:\"When does a civilian stop becoming a civilian?\".  If he houses and shelters guerillas of his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his \"civilian\" status?  What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states  can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the  responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their  soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \"guaratees\"), there is no way Israel is going to accept their \"word\"- not with their past attitude of  tolerance towards \"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\".  If Israel is not willing to accept the \"word\" of others then, IMHO, it has no business wasting others\\' time coming to the peace talks.   But don\\'t you see that the same statement can be made both ways? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall, Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.  Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn\\'t make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah  subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.  That is not exactly true.  The Hizbollah and their affiliated groups have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of Israel.  It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria, Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred. Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain  control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.  Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border? Not lately, eh?  Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the past two years.  True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines.  The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term peace as others in the area might be.

We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the Palestinian\\'s popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement: \"You look for me !\", i.e., I\\'am not making any more efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid\\'s point of view, Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government\\'s and his party\\'s lack of action for human rights and peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists\\' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government, regardless of what it does.  These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin\\'s government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this \"government of peace\", which need not disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \"Rabinic\" policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.  But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation: Let\\'s cut ourselves off from the Palestinians, let\\'s build a fence so high that they won\\'t be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.  Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha\\'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical separation and \\'the future of the territories\\', must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that their ideological support for separation only provides humanitarian\\' arguments for the legitimization of the <status quo>.  Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden. [.....].  Whoover thinks that \\'out of Gaza first\\' is a liberal, humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral.

Dec. 1989  Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua, launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London, last week.  The diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust.  He said the diaspora\\'s religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure of Judaism\".  His talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000 years of Jewish history.  Mr. Yehoshua\\'s other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he said \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews outside Israel \"who were using other people\\'s countries like hotels\".  The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere.  Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.  Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\", ended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in Israel.  Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature, Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country\\'s political situation.  He said Israel\\'s wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been produced about the intifada.  Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity, emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.  Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab\\'s shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood character\".  He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew, and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.  Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life, unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in, he said.  He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English language.     </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/talk.politics.mideast/76388\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/talk.politics.mideast/76388\"> From: dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian) Subject: Turkish Genocide Apology Grants Time Travel to the Dead!

My view is that Israel has made more gestures towards its Arab foes than the opposite. What have the Sysrians given to us or proposed? What have the Palestinians proposed? If the Palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their  charter, or just condemn acts of Palestinian violence that would be a good start.  Perhaps, starting here with an immediate \"accusation\" is not a particularly good way to generate open responses? How about explaining what you see as being Israel\\'s *real worries* and how they *need* to be addressed? Since the \"other side\" sees Israel\\'s \"gestures\" in a completely different light than you do, perhaps \"they\" also have *real worries*. From their point of view, what are they? How can those worries be addressed?   The Palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. Its seems though that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are plagued by internal strife, that is why we are not getting anywhere. Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only vow for the destruction of Israel.  It is certainly much harder to \"reach compromise\" (or, even sit down and talk with...) an other side which is fractured into several different ideologies, each with its own set of \"demands\". While it is up to \"them\" to generate unity on their side, is there anything that Israel can do (without sacrificing its security, its position) to encourage that unification along lines that Israel prefers?  Arabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table, got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation between the two countries.

These criteria are to be found for example in the International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ratified by most countries) The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights The Human Rights Charter The European Convention of Human Rights  If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.   The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.  They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole reason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance. Israel\\'s actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of the State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence - in the area.

For this reason, the war-criminals call all the Bosnian Muslims \"Turks\" even though they are not ethnically Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason, what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically identical but religiously \"other\" is called, paradoxically, \"ethnic cleansing\" rather than \"religious cleansing.\"  Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

The reasons are pragmatic: even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although  I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been  born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land,  yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself  a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature, not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by  Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat:   If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so.  They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own way\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus, in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when  people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and  where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian  Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries.\"[1]  The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).  Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries.\"[2]  human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]  Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years, and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey, however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities, local courts immediately take them under their protection.\"  In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition  to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this  sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of  priests.\" (A.

We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide  you. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of  these suggested activities, the Educational Network can  aid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following  up/, and /providing any other support/ you may need.  Link your teachers\\' union with a teachers\\' union here  linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical  enterprise.  Get your union to actively support the right of  Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form  unions:  a. through the International Labor Organization (if your  union is a member) b. contacting other international unions which have  supported our right to form a union -- we can supply  names and addresses.  Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more  Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university  or school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a  Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university  abroad.  Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian  education:  a. for your union membership; b. for the outside community.  The Educational Network can supply up-to-date  information and statistics.  Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied  Territories during periods when our schools are in  session.  The Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and  local travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the  visit.  Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an  educational tour:  a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and experiences;  b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian education.  The Network will coordinate from Palestine.  Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in  which a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches  at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from  that school spends a year in a Palestinian private school.  Send an experienced educator to the Occupied  Territories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two- day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.  The Network will pay for the person\\'s food, lodging, and  travel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide.  Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in  either English or French.  Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian  school which would actively involve teachers as well as  students at both schools -- a great tool for building  international understanding and mutual sensitivity.  Keep the Educational Network informed about  important educational conferences so that we can send a  Palestinian teacher to attend.  Send to the Educational Network articles or other  writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and  ideas in the field of education so that we can then  disseminate the information locally.  Support an educational development project in the  Occupied Territories.     </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/talk.politics.mideast/77363\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/talk.politics.mideast/77363\"> From: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) Subject: XSoviet Armenia will not get away with the Turkish genocide\\'s cover-up.

Silly me, thinking that the issue was that we are all people, to be treated equally.  Thanks for straightening me out.  Wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights.

The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone\\'s civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it! The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves.

Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result of the coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case, the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.   It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not provide us automatically with our needs,  Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providing us with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  It is not \"produced\": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, for example, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in an earlier time, one of them would have been dinner.  There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to  trade_ it with the the person who produced it.  The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages arrange their affairs.  The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and often freely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food and clothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like their Polynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and shared many things with the other Islanders.  In fact, \"hi\\'ipoi\", the Hawaiian word for \"cherish\" means \"sharing food\".  The Great Mahele, in which the Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich and the poor, was a white man\\'s idea.  In Africa, villagers will often share tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own village and neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been to Africa has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so- called \"theft\" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which, until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.

Anyone who supports the legality of abortion but objects to it being covered by a universal health care program (that covers nearly everything else, as well) is contradicting themselves.    Actually, I believe anyone that supports the legality of abortion but supports it being covered by a universal health care program is contradicting themselves.  I am pro-choice, but I am also anti-government- funding-for-abortion.  Why?    Example:  if a pro-lifer writes on the net that abortion should be illegal, he/she is immediately flamed with \"you have no right to impose your morals on everyone.  If you don\\'t support abortion, don\\'t have one; but don\\'t take the choice away from everyone.\"  By supporting government funding I feel I would be saying \"If you don\\'t support abortions, tough, because you are  paying for them anyway\".  To me this no longer makes it a mutually exclusive choice issue (which invalidates a main argument of many pro-choicers); I would be forcing my morals on pro-lifers.  In this respect I feel the  hypocrisy of supporting government funding and being pro-\\'choice\\' greatly  outweighs any hypocrisy of not supporting government funding and being  pro-choice.  Ok, one last time.  (yeah right)  In order for *you* to \"not pay for any abortions\" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to \"not pay for any abortions\" through tax money.  If this is the case, then women who have reasons for \"needing\" an abortion, but are unable to afford it on their own, are just \"out of luck\".  Their *choice* is blocked because of econonmic hardship--which is part of why they might \"need\" the abortion in the first place--and because *some* people don\\'t want to \"pay for any abortions\".  On top of that, there is the assumed requirement that the governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can\\'t afford it, which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion. This involves *more money*.  Suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women who desire them but can not afford one on their own.  Those who do not want an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they can not afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will be able to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  How then are you \"paying for\" an abortion?  Rather that abortion is \"paid for\" by the cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all because we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure. Notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often used as an example of \"elective surgery\" that is not generally paid for just because it is desired and can not be afforded.)  If you insist on complaining about \"paying for\" someone\\'s choice to have an abortion when they can\\'t afford it, I will complain about \"paying for\" the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it. Why should you pay for someone else\\'s choice?  Why should I pay more to restrict* someone\\'s choice?  a bunch of other stuff deleted - not related to me :) )  A pro-choice majority would not be enough for one of the two pro-choice candidates to win, however a pro-life majority *should* have been enough for the only pro-life candidate to win.

If it\\'s not important enough for you to vote the way you feel because of \"other issues\", then why should anyone take your insistance that \"abortion is wrong\" seriously?  People\\'s perception of the economy and Bush\\'s apparent indifference (coupled with a liberal media) were more likely explanations.    It would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*, unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  In order to be unbiased there would have to be allowance made for \"shades of grey\", rather than lump all of the middle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll I heard about.

There is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise have eventually become a member of society.  That is certainly a non-zero value.  There is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater suffering caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  That woman is *already* a member of society.  I argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society is far greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.  Now, as for your \"deal\".  Suppose you \"pay\" the value of all the suffering of every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* denied an abortion, under your desired position.  And \"we\" will \"pay\" the value of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of it (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).

Although it\\'s possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a  result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he iprobably did, but..?   I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars\\' explanations, but in looking at the texts initially, we can\\'t assume Judas died.  It is,  however, highly probable.                   ^^^^^^  and   Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply means \"hang oneself\".  Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word \"apacgw,\" you will find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I recently checked several Lexicons:  Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\" Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher  A couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit  and stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and the root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\" In literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out of the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then notes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by hanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the added denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete meaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is denoted as the result).   By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":  In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus), it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice  was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and  died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept., APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the result. In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.  Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the Hebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the correct translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus, I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:  There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.  Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all, things change).   Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:  As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"   Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\". But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?   True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\' actions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took the money box, but rather said:  Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and it was night.\"  Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen evidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew), you say:  Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss this with you.  I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we are discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.

If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth, and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.  You are making a ludicrous suggestion.  As a Latter-day Saint, I found John\\'s statement *not at all* ludicrous...  Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri, governor Boggs, issued his so-called \"Mormon extermination order.\"  The only crime (\"illegal activity\") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.  I guess the Mormons \"got what they deserved,\" because they refused to bow to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This \"disobedience\" brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from their lands and settlements...  In the 1850s, the so-called \"Utah-War\" was forced upon the early Mormon settlers, and their \"illegal activities\" consisted no less in living as their conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah\\'s or \"Deseret Territory\" as it was called at the time) constitutional daily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of the United States of America, an entire army under the command of General Johnson (hence \"Johnson\\'s Army\"), invaded the territory to \"restore\" Uncle Sam\\'s law and order...)  History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events that might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit and intent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found in this user-group: when we tried to organize \"soc.religion.mormon\" and/or talk.religion.mormon,\" a whole bunch of \"charitable\" believers effectively blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism et al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a \"threat\" to various establishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa- tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that those who oppose us, point to all kinds of \"justifications\" to do so, despite their claims of adhering to a gospel of love...  In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and I don\\'t even discuss how Uthan\\'s were suckered into allowing part of their lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church leader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\" missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough for the feds to back off.  Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and resolves.  The government\\'s actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Waco was NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a great threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with John, I too wonder who or what\\'s next...  We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of their rights to worship and bear arms.  Now we don\\'t.  Does that include the right to murder little children?  How about killing ATF officers?  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas, but Koresh\\'s folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket launchers.  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under right to bear arms.\"  Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound? What REALLY caused the \"murder\" of the little children?  Could it be that the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco, Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.  David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the \"evil\" guy (by the executioners), while the actions of all those \"valiant and brave\" officers may have been \"regrettable,\" but alas, \"necessary\" to serve some dubious public/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how to sell this one to the nation...  Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.  It has happened before.  Please explain.  I do not remember Jews or Mormons (as a group) overtly breaking a judicious (a.k.a. non-Nazi) law and being punished for it.  Read-Your-History.  It HAS happened (as explained above in some detail), and will undoubtedly happen again. Indeed, WHO IS NEXT.

A. Wells]  There is a great fallacy in your statement. The question of origins is based on more than science alone.    Nope, no fallacy.  Yep, science is best in determining how; religions handle why and who.  The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the supernatural in the question of origins.  Is this is a fair premise?  Not entirely.  Its not a premise, its a conclusion.  Second, that scientists for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity.  Scientists are empircists, not theologians.  I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of truth.  So do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and  fundamental misunderstanding of science.   If you met a man who could walk on water, raise people from the dead, claimed to be the Son of God, and then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures, this would affect your belief in the origin of man.  (I can expand on this.)    Nope, wouldn\\'t affect my knowledge (not belief) of origins of anatomically modern humans.  If that man could show me something better, I\\'d change, even if  it was the biblical story in exact detail.  But then I would ask, \"Why in the world did your father endow us with intellect and reason, and then proceed to fool us.  I mean, the bible says nothing about the human-like creatures that we know exist.  Some of these so-called human-like creatures were apes.  Some were humans.  Some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments.  Absolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into  consideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just  like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of  other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially*  reconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.   But forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and  test out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked us here too?  It won\\'t go away, Bill.     I doubt any of us will meet a man like this.  But, Bill, if your version of all this is absolutely correct, I\\'m still no worried about my salvation.  I\\'ll probaby make it (I don\\'t steal, murder, covet, etc, and I like to help other people).  All I did was use the reason and intellect your god provided.  He or she - benevolent and loving - will understand my dilemma, don\\'t you think?  Good deeds do not justify a person in God\\'s sight. An atonement (Jesus) is needed to atone for sin.  So *you* and other fundamentalists say.  What about the billions who don\\'t  say so?  Beware of people who say they have the truth, Bill, and reconsider each time you think you do.   Science and the Bible are not in contradiction.  God can supercede the scientific laws\" as man understands them.  Creation is a good example.  God has the power to create something out of nothing, order out of chaos.  Haven\\'t been on t.o. long, but I have a feeling, Bill, that the veterans will agree with you here.

The points above are well made,  and obviously there is some discussion as to what the facts are in some cases.  But if you are willing to play along with the definitions,  you too can hit the jackpot.  Science also tends to use the principle of totality (vs locality).  You can always look at a small part of the macrocosm,  yet those miniature pieces are still a part of the total essence.

And you can say that you\\'re looking at a signal instead of listening to noise,  but the beauty of science is that it takes both into account (the totality aspect).  For science to say that light is a wave and NOT a particle (or vice versa) would be to ignore the total essence that is light (which is based upon the agreed upon definitions).

If you are on the outside looking in, it appears that nothing can ever enter the black hole; as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow, and never gets there.

Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.

I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation?

Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good reason* to, don\\'t you?   Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch, then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid of your emotions.  And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.   When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.

You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don\\'t follow Kendigianism. I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to \"priests\",  have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do not follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\"  I follow Christ.  Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you\\'ve led as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you\\'ve led a good life.  Why would you want to live a good life? To you, you die and that\\'s it.  Don\\'t contradict yourself.  You have no reason to live a good life.  It doesn\\'t do you any good in the end.  Your life doesn\\'t do anybody else any good  either because everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?  I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I\\'d worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in which case it\\'s not really all that important.  Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead. Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system in its every detail.  Jesus\\'s death was like a seed.

It\\'s truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The Branch Dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people), but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds for destroying a people.  Excuse me?  WHO destroyed the BD\\'s?  Last I knew, they burned themselves... Prove to me that the FBI, ATF, or the Government in general either burned the compound themselves, or that the BD\\'s had no choice but to commit mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully (a promise that was made twice by Koresh himself, which he broke both times).  At this point in time we don\\'t who destroyed the BDs.  Maybe it was the government; maybe it was Koresh.  I wouldn\\'t immediately rule out the government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members torched Koresh\\'s wood-frame house.  I think that the credibility of the FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best; at worst they are bald-faced liers.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their wood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the compound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cult members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire is no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly the other person may not have even really said that they did it in the first place---we only have the FBI\\'s WORD ON THIS.  I\\'ll believe it when I hear from a cult member\\'s own mouth and not before then.  The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  They claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas masks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF agent to me.  Weren\\'t the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  this is just speculation on my part.  Still, it is something to think about. Here\\'s something else to ponder upon:  the two agents that were planted in the compound might have done something to start that fire.  I don\\'t know if they did it deliberately or not---if they did at all---but I would like to see statements from these two agents on the events that transpired during that day.  I think that they would be rather enlightening don\\'t you think?  They were inside the compound so they ought to have a real good idea of what went on in there.  Of course if they did help burn down the house then I doubt that they would be very forthcoming with any information.  The FBI also mentioned that fire errupted in multiple locations in the compound.  They *may* have said this so that people might be more likely to be convinced that the BDs started the fire.  However, consider that if the FBI did light-up that house would they admit to it?  I think not.  Imagine the public outrage that would ensue if people discovered that the FBI killed 86 people.  Obviously, the FBI would do its best to suppress the truth and make people think the BDs started the fire.  Fire can spread in unusual ways in a wood house--- fires burning in more than one location in a house isn\\'t inconsistent with a house fire.  The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heat despite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributed to starting the blaze.  Also, it was very windy on the day of the fire.  Flames and burning debri might have floated over to parts of the house that weren\\'t already on fire.  Like I said the verdict isn\\'t in yet.  The FBI may very well be guilty of a holocaust.

If it does, you should have a right to decline that \"coverage\" if YOU DON\\'T WANT IT.  The basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for the coverage YOU WANT.  If basically you want \"catastrophic coverage\" you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondingly LOWER premium).  Similarly, you don\\'t have to be COMPELLED to take on a policy covering things like liposuction or hair transplantation, if you DON\\'T WANT THAT KIND OF COVERAGE, again, at a corresponding savings to you.  If you don\\'t want to be \"covered\" for abortion, you should not be COMPELLED to.  To millions of Christians, abortion is not a gynocological examination\" or a \"pap smear.\"  To them abortion is murder.  To them, being \"covered for abortion\" means that they are paying for a \"service,\" which THEY THINK IS EVIL, CLEARLY DON\\'T WANT, and will NEVER USE.  In such a case, all that is happening is that they are being COMPELLED to help pay for OTHER PEOPLE\\'S abortions.  When you are being forced to BUY something you DON\\'T WANT and will NEVER USE, this is called extortion.  When the mafia tells a restaurant owner to \"buy\" a \"juke-box\" for the owner\\'s \"protection\" this is called racketeering.   And if one\\'s access to health care is held hostage to signing a defacto \"loyalty oath\" in support of abortion, by promising to help pay for other people\\'s abortions (when one is clearly opposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.  dennis dzkriz@ocf.berkeley.edu  </doc>\\r\\n<doc id=\"20_newsgroups/talk.religion.misc/83942\" url=\"\" title=\"20_newsgroups/talk.religion.misc/83942\"> From: st922957@pip.cc.brandeis.edu (Arnold Schwarzenweisengreenbluenbraunenburger) Subject: Re: Who\\'s next?

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in any Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word \"Rosicrucian\" in the  name of the organization. I only claim having done some \"homework\" :-)  This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different, it\\'s my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck, English may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)  I proceed:  I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday.  Let\\'s start with the name \"Rosicrucian\". I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met some \\'rosicrucians\\' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)  I\\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I looked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".  Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they descend (at least in part) from what was the \"Gold-und-Rosenkreuz\" (Golden and Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two \"Golden and Rosy Cross\", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with Masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).  You\\'ll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression, i.e., you\\'d probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO.   The first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars English?) from the thirteenth century.  Again, instead of R:s, it should be \"Lectorium Rosicrucianum\" :-). It is curious to know that 3 other RC \\'orders\\' (in the USA) claim to be *non- sectarian*.  The Cathars were a \\'heretic\\' christian sect that directly challenged the \\'authority\\' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church\\'s unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern Italy, then throughout the south of France.   What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity, then that we couldn\\'t become divine as the persons we are currently, but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.  I don\\'t see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with \"us containing something divine\"... And yes I don\\'t like phrases like \"eternal bliss\" either! :-)  How to robotize people and brainwash...

Zoroaster, was The Jewish Discomfort With Jesus Date: 22 Apr 1993 17:35:26 UTC Lines: 281  In article   Bill.Carlson@p0.f18.n104.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Bill Carlson) writes: Since everywhere I look, Zoroaster is suggested as being a probable descendant of Daniel; suppose you prove he wasn\\'t.  Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that, in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being Hebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority  of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has Kethuvim or Writing status.]  Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:  DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name. Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s restoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per- forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name Daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3). The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of several Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith. The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12. The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent. The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation. Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.  ZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from Mazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The etymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name, as uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else- where. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the Greek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old Iranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht, several Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht. We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra, means \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used traditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when Zarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into common use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books of Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.] Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in Western culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented, and heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"), attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the Avesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha Spentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha Vashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the prophet\\'s death. Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger Avesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the Pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid inscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is mentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who seems unaware of him). The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect way, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose was not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the other hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra, although from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him six thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Hermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The account by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes against Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes reference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut Humbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it is generally rejected. Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as the above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time Zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an extremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close to, that of the Achaemenids. Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono- logy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord- ing to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander. Again, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the latter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed by Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra\\'s lifetime roughly around the beginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the part of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this context, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and Vishtaspa\\'s conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander). Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally on the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus the Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of the first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that period, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same time, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be justified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the most legitimate. As to Zarathushtra\\'s land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of valid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that he was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra with Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language of the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose, both on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east, even though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view that he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian region, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however, Zarathushtra\\'s land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would thus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran. Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an athravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used to lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the product of a great and original ethical mind. Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India to Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan, or \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks truth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate - and blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision of asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian mysticism. Zarathushtra\\'s greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength of his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic monotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the evil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl., Frashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti]  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra\\'s teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures. Another original facet of Zarathushtra\\'s message, one that is not easy to understand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the Amesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous devotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.] Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"), and of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of Zarathushtra\\'s life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers. According to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at thirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did he succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility caused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of Kavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two years old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"), and of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more sons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of his second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good cattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned: Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi\\'s father, and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"), whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again, according to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was assassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the Tuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi form). The paucity of information on the prophet\\'s life is compensated by a tradi- tion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian communities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as passages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth century, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i Bahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about Zarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man. Zarathushtra\\'s great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the Renaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien wisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer, psychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always openly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as a precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the biblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three Magi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is derived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the Future. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the Sasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the spread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra\\'s popularity in the Christian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three great messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture and heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss- ance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara- thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was viewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean Oracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a possible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in Voltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom. After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave the name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883- Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between good and evil.

The first individuals to identify themselves using the word atheist lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment. The French Revolution, noted for its unprecedented atheism, witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason. Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of empirical evidence; the problem of evil; the argument from inconsistent revelations; the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified; and the argument from nonbelief. Although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies (eg. humanism and skepticism), there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.'))\n"

    "predictions.append(predictLabel (10, 'The term atheism originated from the Greek atheos, meaning without god(s), used as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society. With the spread of freethought, skeptical inquiry, and subsequent increase in criticism of religion, application of the term narrowed in scope. The first individuals to identify themselves using the word atheist lived in the 18th century during the Age of Enlightenment. The French Revolution, noted for its unprecedented atheism, witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human reason. Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of empirical evidence; the problem of evil; the argument from inconsistent revelations; the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified; and the argument from nonbelief. Although some atheists have adopted secular philosophies (eg. humanism and skepticism), there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.'))\n",

Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASAs predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958. Since that time, most US space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the Apollo moon-landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the development of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.'))\n",

First conceived by Julius Lilienfeld in 1926 and practically implemented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley, the transistor revolutionized the field of electronics, and paved the way for smaller and cheaper radios, calculators, and computers, among other things. The transistor is on the list of IEEE milestones in electronics, and Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement.'))\n",

It was designed for the U.S. government service revolver trials of 1872 by Colts Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company – todays Colts Manufacturing Company – and was adopted as the standard military service revolver until 1892. The Colt SAA has been offered in over 30 different calibers and various barrel lengths. Its overall appearance has remained consistent since 1873. Colt has discontinued its production twice, but brought it back due to popular demand. The revolver was popular with ranchers, lawmen, and outlaws alike, but as of the early 21st century, models are mostly bought by collectors and re-enactors. Its design has influenced the production of numerous other models from other companies.'))\n",

He ranked among the top ten in league scoring for 21 consecutive years and set a league record for points in a season (95) in 1953. He won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings four times, won six Hart Trophies as the leagues most valuable player, and won six Art Ross Trophies as the leading scorer. Howe retired in 1971 and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame the next year. However, he came back two years later to join his sons Mark and Marty on the Houston Aeros of the WHA. Although in his mid-40s, he scored over 100 points twice in six years. He made a brief return to the NHL in 1979–80, playing one season with the Hartford Whalers, then retired at the age of 52. His involvement with the WHA was central to their brief pre-NHL merger success and forced the NHL to expand their recruitment to European talent and to expand to new markets.'))\n",
